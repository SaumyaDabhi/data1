"Brita Standard Water Filter, Standard Replacement Filters for Pitchers and Dispensers, BPA Free, 3 Count","Regular good Brita quality, and fits older pitchers.",4.0,"If you have the earlier version like in my picture you may wonder if these with the thinner top fit.  They do.  The old style counter in my picture won't fit on the new version.  It was not very reliable as a counter anyway, so I always changed filters based upon months of use.I've seen people complain these will float up when you fill the pitcher.  Also that they let water go around the lip of the filter meaning it gets no filtering.  Or that you needed to add an O-ring. If so you don't have it seated fully.  The old one would just drop in and seal fine.  This one you need to wet the lip and then once you drop it in you will need to push quite hard on the top of it.  It will slip in another 1/8th of an inch and you'll feel it bottom out.  Now it won't bypass the filter or float up.  If you check the bottom of the filter once installed, and you can wiggle it about with your finger it is not seated.  Once seated it will be firm and your finger won't be able to wiggle it.","July 2, 2022",Verified Purchase,0

"Brita Standard Water Filter, Standard Replacement Filters for Pitchers and Dispensers, BPA Free, 3 Count",Better than the Long Lasting,5.0,"I live across the road from the Potomac River. Our water has always tasted very chlorinated in this location,  but was tolerable to drink from the tap. I prefer room temp water and am not picky, but my husband wants chilled water and turns his nose up on the tap, so not having a refrigerator dispenser, we’ve had a Brita pitcher for some time. From a promo years back, I’ve just been accustomed to using the long term filters from the beginning, and they’ve seemed to have done their purpose, even if I think it’s more of a placebo effect for hubby.Back in March suddenly one day our water was so badly chlorinated, it even smelled of bleach. We didn’t think much of it, but randomly listening to NPR a local DMV blurb said that areas where drinking water was sourced from the Potomac river were being maintained and with some sort of treatment, so water services would be disrupted in short intervals, and the taste of chlorine would be more noticeable but would be safe and temporary. Three months later it is still intolerable. My cats even have an aversion which is scary.Anyway, our Brita pitcher was barely touching the chlorine. It was making a small difference, but it was still bad. We’ve definitely definitely been drinking less water, and I change up my cat fountain filter more often and refill from our filtered pitcher to help them. Realizing it was probably time to change the filter anyway (do those light indicators work for anyone???) I took into consideration that perhaps the long lasting filters may not work as good as the regular. I mean, why have the two options of there wasn’t an advantage to the short term one?First off: Whoa. I had ZERO idea that a Brita could be filled so quickly. I thought that the obnoxious slow drip was just standard for being filtered. Wrong! I could actually finally fill the entire pitcher from empty without having to wait forever for the reservoir to empty, walking away and coming back in trips to the sink. Better yet? This quick filtering process actually does a substantially better job!I nearly cried just now when I poured a glass of chilled water for the first time from this standard filter. No chlorine!  I can stomach water again.The convenience of refills and maintaining being healthy and hydrated will outweigh any costs of slightly more frequent replacement.","June 19, 2022",Verified Purchase,0

I thought I was as buying refill filters for the faucet filter but they were not and I ha e no idea why it popped up with the Britia faucet filter system other than to take advantage of customers in a hurry. They would not return this item and it is useless to me. Besides I have a tds meter at the house the faucet filter does nothing noticeable to help the water quality and it has zero effect on the total dissolved solids meter. I would not recommend any Britia product l.

"Brita Standard Water Filter, Standard Replacement Filters for Pitchers and Dispensers, BPA Free, 3 Count","Are these knock-offs, or did Brita change its specs?",2.0,"We've been using Brita water pitchers for years. They're especially helpful in Florida, where chlorine and sulfur battle to dominate the taste of tap water. Brita pitchers have always done a good job of making the water taste more like water. I've always bought new filters at the supermarket, but the price here on Amazon was better so I thought I'd give it a try. I made sure to buy from a page that said the filters were both sold and shipped from Amazon, to make sure I was getting real Brita filters and not imitations. Unfortunately, the water from these filters tastes terrible. It has a strange, plastic-y, chemically taste. I waited to write this review until after about a dozen refills of the pitcher, to see if the taste would get better, but the taste is still strong and unpleasant, and makes me wonder what's in the filter. I don't know whether Brita changed its filters to create this bad chemical taste or whether Amazon got a bad batch. The ones from the grocery store still work as usual.","February 20, 2022",Verified Purchase,0

Totally useless. I looked all over the packaging, no dates. On the bottom is said was packaged in 2019 in Canada.

I brought a pack of 3, brand new filters from Brita that I followed the pre filter setup directions on the box and yet my drinking water STILL had black specs in it. I repeated draining and flushing process twice AND IT STILL HAD THOSE BLACKS SPECS IN MY DRINKING WATER! It’s embarrassing to think if I had company over & they saw that & assumed I’m dirty because of Brita’s low quality crappy filters. I am very upset that I was drinking this water and didn’t know until I used a white cup. I know the specs are coming from the Brita filter because the water from my sink has no black specs! When I googled this problem, apparently this is a known thing with Brita filters AND THEY STILL HAVE NOT FIXED THIS PROBLEM.

"Brita Standard Water Filter, Standard Replacement Filters for Pitchers and Dispensers, BPA Free, 3 Count",Flavorless water.  Best filter for Brita Extra Large Water Dispenser.,5.0,"I tried a cheaper Walmart option, but the flavor of water kept coming through.  So I broke down and bought these filters for my Extra Large Water Dispenser by Brita.  It's amazing how well it works.  Literally flavorless water.  Reminds me of Smart Water.Although the filter specifies only 2 months of filtered water, I did some math and found out for the Extra Large Water Dispenser it'll last 33 top tray fillings before it reaches the 40 gallon maximum life of the filter (you have to do some volumetric math to figure this out.  Msg me if you'd like to know how).  After going through an entire filter already (took almost an entire year), I can verify it still works even beyond that amount.The filter takes a long time to let the water through, but I'm in no rush for completely filtered water.  Really I just fill it up twice, put it in my fridge, then return for water when I feel like it.  Be careful leaving the water in the fridge, or it starts to get freezer burn flavor.Finally, when installing the filter, it's designed to sink lower than level with the filter holder, but in only one specific orientation.  When installing, spin it around until it sinks further.  It has a great seal and you can tell by the flavorless taste afterwards.Never had to clean the container.  However, I imagine putting it in the washing machine won't be a problem.  Just don't include the filter.Honestly?  I imagine there are other more affordable filters that're designed exactly the same way (and works just as well), but I haven't found one yet.  I stocked up on 3, since that'll last me more than 2 years easily.","December 10, 2021",Verified Purchase,0

Especially today when commercial water brands that come in 500 Billions plastic water bottles daily are causing great damage annually as they break down in dumps, rivers, lakes, oceans and streams harming fish, mammals, birds, and wild life.

The packs I bought here didn't show any carbon in the water for even the first fill up. Thinking it was a dud, I changed it out for another filter, then another, then another, and all of them the same thing; no carbon particles, and the water tasted like it was right out of the tap, completely unfiltered. I threw them all out, and went to my local grocery store to buy them at a higher price, and sure enough I got the black carbon particles, and the water tasted fresh and filtered.

"Brita Standard Water Filter, Standard Replacement Filters for Pitchers and Dispensers, BPA Free, 3 Count",Brita filters can't handle the worst water we might be using.,3.0,"Brita filtration products are very simple to evaluate.They're undoubtedly a good value in the market for such things, but, otherwise, their value and performance simply comes down to one thing: the level of contaminants in the water you're filtering, to begin with.If you happen to have a municipal water supply that gives you reasonably clean water, but it could be improved upon for taste or purity, Brita's marvelous for you.If you have horrible tap water because of the region in which you live and its unavoidably poor water quality-- if your water contains total dissolved solids in the range of four to five hundred p.p.m., Brita will do little for you. At least Brita's basic products, as I'm reviewing here.Their filtering system simply can't handle highly polluted water.In testing my own, Brita's filters, when new, remove a good part of the total dissolved solids in my water, but not nearly enough to leave a pure and good-tasting water-- or water free of alkaline salts that can be damaging to plants (which is my biggest interest in water purification).TDS goes from between four and five hundred p.p.m., coming from the faucet, to about two hundred p.p.m. in a fresh Brita filter. An improvement, but not a solution.And these Brita filters will become saturated with contaminants, and foul, very quickly, if you have water like mine.I use them along with Zero Water. Believe it or not, I use both. It's crazily expensive, but it's a logical method. It's all about getting the salts out as efficiently and inexpensively as I can.I use Brita filters with the pitcher as a first stage of filtration, and possibly for water that needn't be so pure. I then use Zero Water's much superior filtration to finish removing all the sediments, if I have need of really pure water.That's the story, from my situation. If your water is terribly polluted, Brita does little for you. If your water's so-so to begin with, and you'd like to sweeten it and purify it further, Brita's a great product.","June 3, 2021",Verified Purchase,1

It improves the taste and gets rid of a lot of the metal taste our water has. We used to use the Brita for all of our drinking water, but now only use them for our coffee and tea water.  They need to be replaced too often, for the amount of water the that two of us drink. As long as you change the filter once you start seeing debris in the top reservoir, they work pretty well.We now exclusively buy our Brita filters on amazon. One filter at a local store costs about $10 so being able to get 3 for $15 makes it so much more affordable for us.The one thing that I ,very much, dislike about the whole Brita system is the amount of waste that comes from it.

Well I was led to believe from the advertisment that meant it will work with my dispenser.  I mean surely Brita would not send me filters for a dispenser that I just purchased that do not fit.  As you can plainly see from the photos above, upon inspection of the replacement filter we clearly have two different designs.  The filter on the left in both photos is the one that comes with your dispenser and the replacement is on the right in both as well.

That's all well and good, but should have been mentioned in the description that it was partially recycled.

I will no longer be ordering this product.My low review is in regard to the ""packaging"" for how it was mailed. This is how I found it in my mail box. The thin, flimsy Brita Box had the mailing label on it and was inside a flimsy grocery bag with 2 of the filters out of the box. w  I assume UPS put it in the bag. My brother and I were shocked! As for the product itself, I don't feel it does as good as it once did. I've been using brita water pitchers for several years, but the water is not as good as it once was but better than no filter.

"Brita Standard Water Filter, Standard Replacement Filters for Pitchers and Dispensers, BPA Free, 3 Count",Good Filter,5.0,"The water tastes so much better with this filter.  I have the 5-cup (48 oz) Brita pitcher.  That pitcher measures how good the filter still is by the number of times you pour water from it (in other words the number of times you tip the pitcher to pour water out).  My filter indicator kept indicating 100%, but not knowing at that time how it figured when it was time to replace the filter, I believe I had pressed in the reset button and held it down on several occasions, which was resetting it as if I had replaced the filter.  When I noticed the water wasn't tasting as good as it should, I replaced the filter and realized another way to know when the filter needs replacement, and it is this: When the filter is new, it should take a while for the water to filter down into the pitcher.  Before I replaced the filter, the water was going through the filter quickly.  Since the change in how quickly the water goes into the pitcher gradually increases over time, I didn't really notice the difference.  When I put the new filter in, wow!, it was much slower.  That is when I realized the difference between a good filter and a used, need-to-be replaced one.","July 24, 2020",Verified Purchase,0

The filters have never been so fast in all these years! So I do wonder about it being faulty. The last filter I used, I left it in there longer than it should have been just to see. And it never slowed down. If anything it seemed to speed up! And so I’d like to know more about this and whether they’re working properly.

I have used brita filters for years and usually get 2-3 MONTHS use from them but these are quickly going ""bad"" after 2 weeks use, sometimes only after 1 week...?BUT, they are charging the same price.Side observation of our culture of consumerism; we have become so obsessed with things that are advertised as ""necessary"" namely the latest features of electronic nature,etc.  that we forego logic in the process of the buying decision.Some examples:Vehicles:  considering the modern conveniences, (of which we see new ones each year in new vehicles), as so desirable we seek those and overlook the other mechanical quality, which seem to be diminished with each new model, yet the price goes up and we continue to ""buy into"" this manipulation.Appliances: we see similar ""engineered obsolescence"" in the newer home appliances.  I have a 20+ year old clothes dryer that has the basic settings/features that works just fine, still.  Bought it used at a garage sale.  we have had to replace the drum belt several times but otherwise it still works as well as it did when we first obtained it.  Meanwhile, several friends and family members who saw the latest appliances with ""bells and whistles"" they desired, purchased newer appliances, in the matching style commonly displayed at appliance stores or depts. and have had to either have them serviced for the failure of the electronic features on the flimsy, low quality electronic circuit boards,or purchase replacement ones with ""even better"" features,at a higher price - nevermind the newly designed electronics at a lesser quality than the previous.  All the while, with each generation, the engineered obsolescence is an even shorter lifespan as manufacturers have found even more ""corners"" to cut to save money, yet those savings are not passed on to consumers.  In this cycle we have become our own worst enemy.  The newer purchases fail much sooner, pushing us to buy a replacement, which lasts even shorter time than the previous one.  re-enforcing the manufacturers practices of lowering the quality, yet charging MORE and MORE.","February 8, 2020",Verified Purchase,7

Also make sure the filter sits at the very bottom.Finally, another pointer I wanted to put out there is that the light on top of the Brita which indicates the quality of the filter is not super accurate and based on average results.

I found that the position of the new filter is a littlebit higher than the old one in the slot. So I push it hard until the new filter into the slot as deep as the old one, and then it worked!!!Push hard!The company seems to adjust the size of the filter a little bit (make the filter a little tiny bigger) so that the filter can plugged into the slot more tightly. But if you didn't push hard enough, the filter won't be in the correct position and there will be sapce between the filter and the slot, which will let the water escape without getting filtered.","July 26, 2019",Verified Purchase,0

"Brita Standard Water Filter, Standard Replacement Filters for Pitchers and Dispensers, BPA Free, 3 Count",Great Tasting Water,5.0,"Let me just say upfront, it is disheartening to see that some people have given bad reviews on the Brita Filtration System, claiming their water has black particles, and worse, they think it is black mold. It is not. These comments serve only to prove that the directions had neither been read - nor followed- by the reviewer.You must first understand what the Brita Filter has inside it: a harmless black substance called activated carbon which attracts and absorbs impurities as water passes through it. Before installing a replacement filter you're supposed to hold it under cold running water for 20 seconds - with the water going through the holes at the top, coming out through the holes at the bottom. This is so that excess carbon dust (aka the black stuff) can be rinsed away.I suggest reading about activated charcoal so as to understand it better. It's fascinating stuff!Interesting Fact: If you go to the hospital for a drug overdose or poisoning, depending on the type of drug or poison and how long it has been in your stomach, they may have you drink activated charcoal to absorb it.Placement of Filter: line up the filter groove with the protruding line in the reservoir, press it down firmly into place. Fill upper reservoir with water and allow it to process through. Store in refrigerator. Refill when water level is low.Over the first few fillings it is possible -but not always likely- to see a small trace of carbon dust in the bottom of the pitcher. It does not float in the water, it sinks to the bottom. While it is unsightly, it is not at all harmful. Simply empty the pitcher and give a quick rinse before you refill the top.Use the included Refill Reminder (cling type sticker). Moisten it with just a dab of water and place on pitcher. This way you will know when it's time to replace the filter. It is recommended to replace every 2 months, but it really depends on how much water you go through. One filter cleans 40 gallons. If you're going through more than a gallon a day, you'll need to replace the filter every 6 weeks. If you only use a half gallon a day, you can go more like 10 weeks. The important thing is to change the filter and clean the pitcher on a regular basisCare: The water in a dishwasher gets too hot and can cause tiny cracks in your pitcher. To properly care for your Brita  and guarantee years of use, hand wash with warm water, a soft dish cloth and a dab of regular dish soap. Be thorough. Rinse well. Do this every time you change the filter. Don't forget to remove the reminder sticker when washing so it doesn't wind up in the drain. After washing, replace sticker with the new date.Some of the Brita Models may have different guidelines, depending on pitcher size and filter alert systems. I'm using - and referring to- the basic model. There is no filter alert light, just the sticker. Whatever model you're using, remember that keeping the pitcher clean and changing the filter as recommended is the key to good-tasting water.An added perk, pun intended, Brita Filtered water will make your coffee (or tea) taste much better! Try it!I've been using a Brita for about 40 years. I live in a place where the tap water does not taste very good, but Brita makes it taste clean, fresh, and natural. I highly recommend it to all with the stipulation that you read and follow the instructions provided.","March 28, 2019",Verified Purchase,0

"Brita Standard Water Filter, Standard Replacement Filters for Pitchers and Dispensers, BPA Free, 3 Count",Filters don't work.,1.0,Looks to me like these filters are actually designed to clog. Complete waste of money.  Mine clogged on the second filling. It appears that white plastic beads are added to the filter material to move down and eventually block the water outlet holes so you're forced to buy a new one. They probably designed it to fail after the suggested  40 gallons but it usually happens to mine after the first gallon. Completely useless and only seves as fodder for the landfill. This the the only time I'm felt compelled to write an Amazon review. They're that bad. Same thing happened with PUR.

I will make them keep sending me filters until I have 5 working filters on principle, but I will also be replacing Brita with a different pitcher and filter system, especially after seeing ALL the reviews with filter problems.

You simply hold onto the top, which acts as a handle, and place them into the pitcher. Similarly, you just hold onto the ""handle"" when you need to remove the filters. Previously, I would struggle to place the filters in and I needed to tip the pitcher sideways in order to replace the filters.I also think that these new filters work better than the previous filters. I've found that I have a lot less black particles in the compartment where the filter is located in the pitcher. It also no longer ""pops out"" when I tip the pitcher to pour out the last drops of water, which had been an issue with the previous filter model. In addition, the water seems to taste cleaner : )The two filters arrived packaged in a small brown box labeled 'Replacement Filters.' I was surprised that they weren't sent in the usual Brita branded packaging, however, upon opening the package I realized that this was a more efficient way to receive the product. I can also store the smaller box more easily in the kitchen drawers.","February 4, 2019",Verified Purchase,6

"Brita Standard Water Filter, Standard Replacement Filters for Pitchers and Dispensers, BPA Free, 3 Count",REMOVES THE AFTER-TASTE FROM SOFTENED WELL WATER,5.0,"I have well water.  We use a Kenmore water softener.  Last time I checked, our water was about 17 grains of hardness, which is not bad.  We have 2.5 ppm of iron.  Our softener works well, and we have no problem with the softened water for anything except drinking.  We have carried gallon jugs back and forth to my daughter's house, filling them with her city water for drinking.I have seen the Brita ads for many years, but just figured it would not correct the taste of our softened well water.  So on PRIME day, I bought the 5-cup Brita Metro pitcher and gave it a try.  I was gob-smacked!  The funny ""softened well water"" taste was completely gone!  It actually tastes better than the city water.  My next Brita pitcher will be larger.  I am mad at myself. . . . I could have been drinking this water all this time.","July 21, 2018",Verified Purchase,0

"Brita Standard Water Filter, Standard Replacement Filters for Pitchers and Dispensers, BPA Free, 3 Count","Water goes through too fast. Bad taste and salty residue on ice trays, coffee machine, kidneys?",2.0,"I was really happy with Brita until my latest box of 3 filters. I'm not sure if they changed the design or the filter material itself, but now the water goes through in a really fast, steady stream instead of the slow drops that used to come out. The water has a weird taste, and I'm finding salty residue on our ice trays, in the coffee machine, etc., so I'm really scared what kind of residue it's leaving in our kidneys since we drink that water all day.First, I saw how fast the water was going through a filter. I pushed it as far in as possible and tried anything else I could think of, but it didn't help because the water isn't leaking from the sides of the filter; it's going through the 4 bottom holes too fast. The same thing happens when I run it under the tap. So, it's not a matter of leaking or not being airtight. I figured that first filter was defective so I opened a second filter, but the same thing happened. I let the second filter dry out and used the first one for the last two months. I went to use the second one, but it smelled bad even though I had let it air out and stored it open so it wouldn't mold. So, I opened the third one and the water went through in the same fast stream.Hopefully these 3 were defective and the product hasn't been changed, but I see lots of others having the same issues, so I'm not going to risk reordering. It looks like I'll have to look for another brand.","July 5, 2018",Not Verified,0

"Brita Standard Water Filter, Standard Replacement Filters for Pitchers and Dispensers, BPA Free, 3 Count","Overall, okay to good.",3.0,"Arrived as pictured but...I'll second at least one other purchaser and warn that this version of the filter does have a very annoying flaw; it does indeed frequently slide (up) out of the tube area meant to hold it. Of course, then the unfiltered water is able to stream along the sides and into the lower reservoir, mostly nullifying the purpose. If you simply try to push the filter back in, the water that made it between the filter housing and tube/upper reservoir wall acts like a lubricant, causing the filter to slide out of position even easier, more often.For a simple, free fix, I cleaned and placed one of those rubber bands sometimes included around bundles of vegetables at the grocery market around the crown of the filter to increase the diameter and function as a seal. The caveat, it's very difficult to position the rubber band because, based on my testing, it must hug the very top edge of the filter for optimum results. Unfortunately, crown is slanted and smooth enough to cause the rubber band to slide down effortlessly. Hopefully, this method lasts throughout the life of each filter. If so, I can deem the hassle acceptable.","January 29, 2018",Verified Purchase,6

(Purchased a package of 3 filters.) I came here to read Reviews and see what others were experiencing and how they were dealing w the mold problem. Then tried a 2nd filter from the package, but the water smelled of mold within 2 DAYS. I wrote to Brita directly. They asked for and received all the particulars on the package, like zebra code, UP, date and proof of purchase. I thought they might then trace the manufacturing site and let me know an outcome. I even asked for their suggestions. When I didn't hear back in a week, I emailed them again to remind them. No reply and still none, 2 months later. After years of trusting Brita brand, ended up trying a PUR pitcher and filter. It's a wonderful relief to have good tasting and fresh smelling water again. I sent a large box of old, used Brita filters to their recycling program, after taking a picture, w new PUR products, to send to Brita. If this gets resolved some day, I can re-post later.","January 21, 2018",Verified Purchase,2

"Brita Standard Water Filter, Standard Replacement Filters for Pitchers and Dispensers, BPA Free, 3 Count",We were very disappointed in these filters,1.0,"We were very disappointed in these filters.  We purchased the Britta Ultra Max on Amazon which came with one filter.  It worked great!  Water tasted great.  Then we ordered this 3 pack of filters but the water has tasted like dirt ever since.Update:  We have used all three filters in the box, all with the same outcome, horrible tasting water.  We did keep the original filter.  After comparing the original filter to the replacements there is a BIG difference in the amount of filter material in the cartridge.  Big difference!  The repalcements are only half full, if that.  The charcoal or whatever is in the filters is different from the original to the replacement filters.  DO NOT BUY THESE!

"Brita Standard Water Filter, Standard Replacement Filters for Pitchers and Dispensers, BPA Free, 3 Count",Great tasting water that’s filtered clear and clean,5.0,"I’ve been using Brita products for many years and have always been a happy customer. These filters are an update to the old design. They filter water really well and are super easy to use. They are advertised to fit all Brita pitchers. Although I cannot comment on this as I now have a new style pitcher. They fit right in and stay put until they need replacement. They’re rated up to 40 gallons, but that is relative to where you live and that water you have. I usually replace mine every three months with two people using the water pitcher. It’s recommended that the filter is rinsed under running cool water for 15 seconds before installing it in the pitcher. I then discard the first two filtered batches before using it. I’d recommend rinsing the pitcher and wiping it on the inside during the filter replacement since microscopic sediment settles overtime.I got the 3-pack here through Amazon and it usually averages around five bucks per filter unless there’s a sale or a coupon available. I would recommend buying these directly through Amazon as some third-party sellers do sell fakes. Trust me, I’ve run into this with these filters and shaving razors. Generally if these are purchased through a trusted seller or a brick and mortar store, then it’s the real thing.I’m very happy with these filters. The filtered is clear, clean and tastes great!","July 6, 2017",Verified Purchase,11

The water comes through clear, tastes fine, smells fine.  After about a month, there's a definite layer of a powdery orange something on the bottom of our dispenser and so I clean it and switch out the filter.  The package says to switch the filter out every two months.  No, we don't go through an exceptional amount of water (it's just my husband and myself, and I drink less than a glass of water a day ... no joke, yes I know it's not healthy).  We tested a sample of the sediment water as well, the test found nothing harmful and we're not dead yet so I guess we'll just keep drinking it, whatever it is.","June 24, 2017",Verified Purchase,130

"Brita Standard Water Filter, Standard Replacement Filters for Pitchers and Dispensers, BPA Free, 3 Count",Brita does reduce TDS.,4.0,"I'm basically reviewing the Brita system.  I've tried several of the off brand filters to try and save some money, but the only filters that I have come across that reduce TDS are the Brita brand.  Of course, there is Zero Water which is not an economical solution IMO and also reportedly has reported issues with turning the water acidic before the filter is ""spent"" and is still removing solids.  At any rate, there must be a DI resin in the Brita filters that the generics that I have tried do not have.  And this is the thing that I think is unrealized ... the Brita system does reduce total dissolved solids.  It is not just a particulate and carbon ""taste"" filter.  TDS out of our tap is around 150.  First pass from a new Brita cuts it in half.  Second pass cuts it by about 60% more.  I mix Brita filtered water, half and half, with distilled and need to get the Brita filtered water TDS down into the 30's so that, when mixed with distilled water (0 TDS), the mix is below 20 TDS.  I drink almost nothing but water and my water has to have virtually no taste at all.  Below 20 TDS, the water is taste free to my palate.  My wife drinks water with a little of the flavor that comes in the small squeeze bottles, and she drinks tea.  One pass through the Brita is fine with her.  Between the two of us, we get about 10-14 days from a Brita filter.  No where near 200 gallons, or whatever Brita claims.  But again, I have some strange requirements.  At any rate, 10-14 days is about the time where it takes 4 passes through the filter to be able to get the TDS down low enough for my palate (20 TDS or less, mixed with 1/2 distilled) and it becomes too much of a chore.  Probably not a bad thing to change the filter more often as the pitcher gets cleaned frequently.  The bottom line is that we really aren't saving much money using the Brita system over buying bottled water.  Maybe a few bucks because we don't need to buy spring water for my wife so it's convenient to only have to lug 3 gallon bottles of distilled from the grocery store each week for my finicky palate and no spring water since my wife is good with the Brita.  We haven't tried the PUR or any other system.  And we wont try the Zero Water because of the reported issues with low PH acidic water (sour) and the cost of the filters.  All in all, the Brita system works pretty well for us and the filters don't cost an arm and a leg.  We've been using the Brita for 3 or 4 years now.  There are often good deals here on Amazon for 5 or 6 packs of the filters too.  Not perfect, but a pretty good system for us.","March 26, 2017",Verified Purchase,8

"Brita Standard Water Filter, Standard Replacement Filters for Pitchers and Dispensers, BPA Free, 3 Count","They need an O-Ring to seal them, but then they work great",4.0,"They work well AFTER you get an o-ring to seal them.  After seeing the issue others have, water leaking AROUND the filter instead of going through it, and making very certain it was correctly seated, I put a thin rubber o-ring around the filter (most hardware stores carry these) which is reusable (I've had one o-ring for 7 filters so far).  The o-ring makes seating it firmer as I push the filter in, and SEALS the filter so water must go through it.  Get a thin one, it must fit between the filter and the wall of the insert area.  I put the ring about 3/4"" from the top of the filter, then push it in, and I can feel the o-ring ""rolling"" up the filter as I push and it seats the filter in very firm and tight.  **See pics.  This about a 2"" o-ring, and they are cheap.  Brita should use this idea and send a small o-ring with each 3 pack or pitcher. I think people who are complaining about the water quality don't realize the water is leaking around the filter and not being filtered.  After the O-Ring, it takes MUCH longer for the water to go through the filter, so I know it's working.","February 25, 2017",Verified Purchase,840

Cover of pitcher isn't quite right, but it works OK.",3.0,"I purchased a Brita Grand pitcher somewhere else, and when the filter that came with the pitcher needed replacement, I ordered a 3 pack of the newest Brita filters that are supposed to fit all Brita pitchers.  The new Brita filters looked like the old one, but none of them fit in my pitcher properly.  I could still use the pitcher, but it is awkward because the cover doesn't fit, so you have to hold on to the cover so it doesn't fall off while you pour.  The filtered water tasted fine, though.  Now I need more filters and I don't want to keep struggling with the cover.  What to do!2 Weeks Later:  Brita left me a message saying they were sorry I was having trouble and inviting them to call them.  I called.  They said that both the newer and older design of filters will fit in the Brita Grand pitcher.  They are sending me a free 3-pack of the newer design.  After talking to them, I bought a single filter because I couldn't wait for the shipment to arrive. I think the problem is actually with my pitcher.  The top fits INCREDIBLY tightly, as if it wasn't molded quite right.  Without any filter inside, I had to really jam it in place, as in ""I think what I'm about to do is going to break this thing, but what do I have to lose.""  With the filter in place, the cover still pops up about 1/16th of an inch on one side.  But what the heck, it works.  I'm going to raise my review one star, because Brita acted very promptly and responsibly.  It's nice to do business with a company like that.  I also changed my review's title.","February 5, 2017",Verified Purchase,1

No lengthy conditioning.I *do* agree with thoese who say they don't seem to stay put in the pitcher, they seem to come a tad lose after you pour a fast glass of water and move the (old) pitcher vigorously. I am not sure if they stick more solidly in newer pitchers.But all that said - I haven't observed them leaking water. What if they seem a tad loser... as long as they easily fall back into place, that's fine. And my impression is they do. I'd prefer for them to lock in a solidly as the old models, but I haven't noticed drawbacks yet. I think they filter up to the old standard... which isn't the most amazing standard according to very visible online reviews, but it works for me.The Brita system doesn't filter out all the possible stuff - but it does OK with the stuff it claims to filter, and the new system doesn't flake.","January 17, 2017",Verified Purchase,0

However, I found that the new filter style leaked some water down the side of the filter after the install, instead of going through the inside element. After looking at it, I pushed down harder on the replacement filter to seat it correctly. The upper lip of the replacement filter is now just below the lower lip of the housing. That fixed the problem. Now all water exits through the four holes in the filter bottom. The older filters did not require as much elbow grease. Hope this helps those complaining about leaking filters or tap-tasting filtered water. We've enjoyed our Brita for years and I hope it continues to last.","January 3, 2017",Verified Purchase,125

These filters float right out of their ""secured"" spot once a certain amount of water is beneath them.

This was my first time buying the newer filters that don't need to be soaked. I opened one and rinsed it for at least a minute before using. There was no problem with the filter snapping firmly into place. I ran four pitchers of water through before drinking. However, the filtered water subsequently had a strong acrid taste. Other family members sampled it and said the same thing. I opened a second new filter out of the three pack and the same thing happened again. My tap water before being filtered does not have an plastic/metallic aftertaste, so it was definitely something added by the filter.This seems to be a rare occurrence but a couple of other Amazon reviewers have mentioned the same thing, as well as many others at consumeraffairs.com, who claim it made them ill. I can't keep buying expensive filters trying to find some that aren't ""bad"" and ended up buying a different brand of pitcher.

"Brita Standard Water Filter, Standard Replacement Filters for Pitchers and Dispensers, BPA Free, 3 Count",Better tasting water,5.0,"Brita is my favorite brand of water filter! I generally change my filter every 2 months (without letting the filter dry out) and it has made my tap water taste so much better. This 3 pack is the perfect amount for me and having back up filters available is ideal for busy schedules since this ordering a new filter slips my mind now and then. In the correct type of pitcher, these filters will fit snugly, creating a water tight seal that will allow efficient filtering. The price for 3 filters is pretty reasonable and they are worth the money to have drinkable water at home. One thing to note is that on this item's sales page it says that you do not need to soak the filter prior to use. However, the instructions that come with the package says that you should soak the filter before use! This is not that much of a hassle and it helps to get rid of any black flecks that may come out. Overall, I would highly recommend this product and other Brita brand products.","November 18, 2016",Verified Purchase,3

"Brita Standard Water Filter, Standard Replacement Filters for Pitchers and Dispensers, BPA Free, 3 Count",Shame on you Brita,2.0,"I've always thought that Brita or Pur are the pioneers of pitcher type water filtration brands.  However, after getting into hydroponics and really understanding water quality, I honestly don't think that Brita is that great at all.  The standard measurement of effectiveness of a filter is testing the TDS or Total Dissolved Solids in the output water.  I live in Washington, DC and our TDS comes out of the tap at roughly 210 ppm. (the aim for purest water would be 0 ppm).  After running it through thousands of Brita filters all my life, I'm realizing that it only filters a little little bit of impurities.I recently got a laboratory grade calibrated Electric Conductivity (EC) meter which in essence is the measurement for total dissolved solids.  In North America, this value is either multiplied by 700 or 500 to get the value in ppm.  I am 100% sure of the accuracy of my new meter.  Measuring the output water from Brita, I get a reading of only 198 ppm.  So, all it filtered out was about 10 ppm???  That is hardly filtering.  That is running water through a cheese cloth!!!How can I be so sure I'm right?  Well, let's use another water filter, namely, 
ZeroWater Replacement Filter for Pitchers, 2-Pack - ZR-017
, the water filters out SUPER SLOW in this one, but the output water actually measures at ZERO ppm!!!  I've used my meter on distilled water bought from the store and it's also 0 ppm.  I've used my meter on a Reverse Osmosis system my friend has and the output water also reads 0 ppm.I seriously think that all the rave of ""My water tastes so good"" etc.... is purely anecdotal and probably a placebo effect.  I am actually very very disappointing that Brita has governed the market for SUCH A LONG TIME, living on ignorant folks (myself including), anecdotal evidence.","October 20, 2016",Verified Purchase,181

Used to be a great product, used this for 15 years in my Brita water pitcher & Rectangular dispenser. They revamped the product design last year. Now the water just pours through and does NO filtering. I called the company and they told me to push filter down very hard and that it would stay put and filter properly. As soon as water starts to come from tap, the filter loosens and pops out! Even if I hold it down during this lengthy process, the water simply pours through.  I hoped after 2 weeks of this torture that it would get better; it did not. I tried a taste test: the tap water tasted exactly like the ""filtered"" water. After SO MANY years as a satisfied customer, I have sadly decided, after 10 months of torture with the ""new"" product, that I will throw out my Brita items and try another brand.

"Brita Standard Water Filter, Standard Replacement Filters for Pitchers and Dispensers, BPA Free, 3 Count",Redesigned Filters a Disaster,1.0,"I have been happily using Britta pitchers for decades. However, I recently bought my first pack of the redesigned replacement filters and am VERY dissatisfied with their quality.I was delighted to read that they no longer require soaking, but I noticed right away that the filters do not fit snugly into the pitcher system, as the old ones did. I have both a classic full-sized round pitcher and a square ""fridge door"" model, and this was the same on both. The filter fits loosely into the slots, and it is obvious that water can go around, rather than through, the filter into the tank.I went ahead and tried the filter, but it is clearly the case that the water is not being properly filtered. I can distinctly smell and taste the metals from my old pipes in my filtered water.I am pretty shocked that a company with the sterling reputation of Brita would put such an inferior product on the market. There is no way I will continue to use this inferior product.","August 28, 2016",Not Verified,0

You no longer need to do a pre-soaking before using it and it is easier to install, very convenient. Filtered water is so pure and clear that can really eliminate the smell of tab water and some harmful substances, no black flecks in the water anymore.Considering the taste, the filter helps to improve the taste of the tap water and the water is crystal clear with a clean and fresh taste. Significantly, by using it to transfer the tap water into more pure drinking water, it also is an economic and eco-friendly life style compared with the bottle water.Altogether, with the great filter, I can drink the water that is healthier. This is a happy purchase and I will order it again if the filters need to be replaced again for several months. these 3 pks can last really long.","August 24, 2016",Verified Purchase,1

The button on the top of the filter allows for easy installation and replacement. Brita guarantees that Brita brand filters will work in any of their products, and in my experience, this has been the case. The filter uses activated carbon to filter the water.I purchased a three pack for $12 with Prime shipping versus my local store price of $25 dollars for three. They arrived individually wrapped and unharmed in a box. When opened, the filters can be moist because packaged in a way so that they are ready for immediate use.Note: on the instructions that the first one or two pitchers of water should be used to water plants or similar to allow the filter to begin functioning properly. I drank the first few pitchers despite this warning, and the water tasted fine without any carbon residue.","July 19, 2016",Verified Purchase,1

So here you go! This product is for EVERYONE! I'm a mid-20s male with 4c hair that I normally would shave off, but the pandemic had left me growing out my curls for almost 2+ years. I figured this was a good time to try an all-natural product that might help me appreciate my natural hair more. Plus, I am terrible at shaving my own head.I have used this product daily for about 3 months post wash and am pleased with the results. While I do feel the cream is a bit heavy for daily use I've learned brushing the product through, or switching to applying every other day sometimes does the trick. If I miss more than three days I immediately notice a drastic difference in the moisture/curl retention of my evergrowing fro. I don't blow dry or braid my hair, I just gently pat my head dry after the shower, air dry for about 20 mins, then apply TGIN. Then I let the curls fall where they may.I am planning on adding the Miracle Repair Rx shampoo/conditioner combo from TGIN to my hair care regimen over the next few months to see if this makes a difference in maintaining moisture.Overall, I am very satisfied with this TGIN product as it has helped me build back a healthier set of hair. My particular curls require a bit more moisture hence the 4-stars, however, I am hopeful other TGIN products may be able to help me on my natural hair journey.","January 23, 2022",Verified Purchase,0

About every other day, I wash my hair, apply pure coconut oil, a dollop of leave in conditioner, and finish with TGIN. I use a Denman brush to define my curls, and then either air dry or use a diffuser dryer on cool air to dry my curls and add some volume.Try it!

tgin Butter Cream Daily Moisturizer For Natural Hair - Type 3c - Type 4c - Kinky - Moisture - Styler - Sulfate free - Dry Hair - Curly Hair -12 Ounce,Just what my low-porosity hair needed!!,5.0,"This TGIN butter cream is AMAZING for my low porosity hair! Lately, my hair has gone through another transition and it's super dry (I would say extremely thirsty and brittle). No matter what I've done to add extra moisture lately, nothing seemed to work. I even slept with a conditioning cap to help lock in the moisture at night.I came across this butter cream on Amazon and took a look at the reviews. I saw someone post that they used this for their low-po hair, so I decided to give it a try (I also purchased the conditioning shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in conditioner as a ""set"" to see how my hair reacts to new products. I figured my hair was tired from my old routine and products).Before I took a shower, I added this cream to my bone-dry hair. I massaged it in and spread it from roots to the ends. I did not pre-wash my hair, so the other products I used were still in my hair somewhere. The point is that I didn't use the butter cream on freshly washed hair, and I used it ""on top"" of other products. Admittedly, my hair felt a little sticky at first, but I think it was due to the other products in my hair.After the butter cream melted into my curls, I immediately saw a difference! My hair is short on the sides and I noticed that the cream was thick enough to ""slick"" down the edges and baby curls, but it wasn't heavy. My hair had a glow to it, like it was restored to a healthy shine instead of a dead, dry look. I showered without a cap, to let the steam settle in and to get my hair slightly damp. That is exactly what my hair needed to get my curls bouncing again! After dampening my hair, the stickiness I felt before faded and my curls softened. I am super excited about this product. Here is what I like about the butter cream so far:- The branding is a aesthetically pleasing. I like the colors.- The size is a good trade off for the price. I felt that I got a great value for the money I paid.- It's rich, thick, and creamy, so I didn't need to use a lot of product to get results.- The scent is delicious. It has a light, fruity smell but it's not overwhelming. It's very pleasant.- It works for my low-porosity hair.","April 14, 2021",Verified Purchase,17

My hair is 4b/c.  Nothing was working, not even the products that would normally work. I’ve heard of TGIN but stayed away because of its price. Also because my stands are fine (I have a lot of hair on my head) I was worried it would weigh down my hair.  I was desperate and decided to go ahead and buy after reading the reviews. I’m so glad I did. I used this to twist my hair and it’s like new hair was put on my head. My hair is so moisturized and not greasy.  I used it to twist my hair and they came out so luscious and the definition came out great. I also noticed before I twisted my hair it defined my coils, the frizziness was gone. What I like best about this produce is that a little goes a long way so it will last a while. I tested a small area. I had put too much and it made my hair straight so do be careful  with putting too much if you have fine strands. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking to moisturize your hair and want it soft. The scene is light and is not overwhelming.

It has been about a month of consistent use, and I am disappointed.  I will not be buying this product again. I think it would work better for someone with type 3 or low porosity hair. Bummer, but everyone’s hair is different.","April 23, 2020",Verified Purchase,2

tgin Butter Cream Daily Moisturizer For Natural Hair - Type 3c - Type 4c - Kinky - Moisture - Styler - Sulfate free - Dry Hair - Curly Hair -12 Ounce,One of the BEST product(s) on the Market!,5.0,"This is my first time trying this line. I am 1,000% happy with how amazing this product smells & feels. I have 3B high porosity hair. I've tried so many products like most females; my styling essentials looked like a display from a hair show.  I started watching Youtube videos only for my hair type & what a difference it made. I LISTENED to various reviews and made changes accordingly. What I took away from these videos & what is now working for me:1. Stop mix-matching too many products. Two many products can cancel out each other, which can weigh-down one's hair; even promote breakage, and leave hair feeling dry/brittle.2. Apply Shampoo/Conditioner & Hair Cream's by sectioning hair.3. Forget brushes to detangle; use your fingers & don't forget to crunch those curls.4. Sulfate-Free Shampoo only!!!5. Only choose products that are formulated for YOUR HAIR TYPE!!!!6. Cheaper doesn't mean better; buy QUALITY products; your hair will thank you! Not to say, Walmart brands won't work; again, use suggestions for your hair type.7. Healthiest hair types tend to be: Chemical FREE (dyes, heavy/too many/wrong hair products); NATURAL is best!8. Hair needs to BREATH! Give hair a break from wigs, falls, weaves/extensions, etc...(YOU CAN DO IT!)9. Stay away from using heat on hair everyday! Maximize 2-3x's a week!10. Stop using body towels. Use an old t-shirt instead.11. For Daily Moisture: Use a spray bottle w/Essential Oil. I am currently loving Grape Seed Oil.I've also tried Avocado,  Coconut, Black Castor Oil & Jamaican Black Castor Oil...For face highly recommend: Wheat Germ, Shea Butter & Aloe VeraBody: Golden JoJoba Oil, Cocoa Butter, Sweet Almond Oil & Lavender Oil  ** Buy oils from: bulkapothecary.com  ---  ** Don't use all at once.Recommendations for 3B hair: One 'n Only (Restorative Mask) w/Argan Oil - for hot oil treatments. Use with a heating cap for 15-20min. Does wonders. Leave hair super soft & manageable.2. Joico: Moisture Recovery (Conditioner) - WILL NEVER GO WITHOUT!! Absolute best!!! A bit pricey so use sparingly.3. Simply Curls: Coconut Oil & Shea Butter (Curl Enhancer), OR - African Pride: Shea Moisture (Bouncy Curls Pudding)4. Clarify Shampoo: Paul Mitchell: Awapuhi Shampoo5. Leave-In Conditioner: Regis Design: Olive Oil. Pricey but worth it.6. Organix Conditioner: Repairing Awapuhi Ginger. Pricey but worth it.7. To help Soften/Stretch Curls: Africa's Best: Hair Softening System w/Extra Virgin Olive Oil8. Help Grow Hair: Wild Growth Hair Oil. Stay away from pills; helps promote facial hairs, OR - Sadora Paris: Cheveux Noirs Hair Growth Oil (buy online only)9. Daily Moisturizer: Carol's Daughter: Healthy Hair Butter10. Hair Gel Cream: Design Essentials: Natural Almond & Avocado Curl Defining Creme Gel11. Daily Moisturizer: TGIN: Butter Cream Daily. This is such a great quality product (A MUST-HAVE) to one's hair assemble. It has a very pleasant scent; not too overbearing but subtle and pleasant. I apply after using my spray bottle routine (See #11 Above); which seems to work best when sectioning hair. I use every 2-3 days; it does seem to hold. I'm so impressed with this product, I'm actually going to buy their, ""Sweet Honey Hair Milk And Moisturizer"" next. I honestly think this is a good hair line and am anxious to try several additional products.Sorry, for the lengthy review but, hope this helps. I DO NOT work for any of these hair product companies, this review is honest and products I've actually used myself. My hair/curls is the healthiest it's ever been (coming from someone who had to do the BIG CHOP, TWICE). I am 100% all natural & no longer go to beauty salon's. Current hair length when wet is shoulder length. It's been a long, hard battle, but I'm finally winning!!!!  NAMASTE.","January 23, 2020",Not Verified,1

tgin Butter Cream Daily Moisturizer For Natural Hair - Type 3c - Type 4c - Kinky - Moisture - Styler - Sulfate free - Dry Hair - Curly Hair -12 Ounce,"Great for hair growth, frizz, and laying down edges",5.0,"I have been using this for three months now and I have to say I really like it!I don’t put heat in my hair as a general rule unless I’m at the hairdressers , usually I let my hair air dry, then put it up in sponge rollers to get body and do vintage styles.Because I don’t use heat, even though my hair dries naturally wavy, it’s usually EXTRA frizzy and big so I’m constantly looking for hair creams to control the frizz but not weigh it down or make it greasy.I have to say this stuff works pretty well!I use it in conjunction with my Lush R&B and boy have I seen a difference!You only need a dime sized amount, in fact, if you use too much it can dry flakey, weigh your hair down and make it greasy, but if you use the appropriate amount, it’s wondrous!Especially on my edges.Because I don’t use heat, my edges are the hardest to keep down, they dry super curly and stick out.To get them to lay down I simply cover my fingers lightly in the cream,touch the edges,brush them down, then tie a scarf around just the edges, I let my hair air dry and they come out super smooth!I included some pics of my hair just air dried after putting in sponge rollers, but I didn’t tie down the edges so you can see how wavy the front is.My hair is a lot less frizzy, and when I brush down the edges, they stay smooth!I love that the smell isn’t too strong and it makes my hair softer.It’s also helped with hair growth as well which is probably great for everyone else, but I like to keep my hair a bit longer than shoulder length ( for doing vintage styles) and using this stuff has made my hair grow 6 inches in 3 months.Normally I’d get about 3 -4 inches every 6 months so I really noticed a difference!This means more haircuts for me which is kind of a drag but I guess it’s cool that my hair is growing so fast.🤷🏽‍♀️I should mention that I use a myriad of moisturizing/ repair sulfate free shampoos and conditioners, and I also give myself a jojoba hot oil treatment weakly.My hairdresser says my hair is super healthy and even asked what I was using in my hair, so I’d say this cream is a pretty great buy if used sparingly!","September 16, 2019",Verified Purchase,86

I have high porosity 4c hair but it is neither thick or course. I would describe my hair as medium thickness. My hair restains moisture well. I use this product almost every other day. I tried using it daily but it over-moisturizes my hair. It works great with twist outs and it leaves my hair soft and shiny. I also love the smell. I would recommend this product to people with hair in the three and four texture group. It would be entirely too heavy for someone with wavy hair.

Damp didn't work, but using it on dry hair did. This means that after I wash, I have to let my hair air dry for an hour or go under the hair dryer until my hair is 90% or more dry before adding my leave in or moisturizer. Adding my leave in on dry hair also produced fabulous results. I've tried so many products since going natural in 2014, but none worked because my technique was wrong.

tgin Butter Cream Daily Moisturizer For Natural Hair - Type 3c - Type 4c - Kinky - Moisture - Styler - Sulfate free - Dry Hair - Curly Hair -12 Ounce,Great Product!!!,5.0,"I literally never do reviews but for this i MUST. it’s nice and thick and smells SOOO good, but of course for some it may be too perfume-y. Now, some say it flakes, AS IT DOES, KIND OF. It honestly depends on how much you are using because it is THICK and how clean your hair is. when i first applied it my hair already had a weeks worth of numerous products in it, so of course it flaked a bit during the first application which disappointed me at first, BUT; I decided to keep rubbing it in and VOILA , flakes were gone and mixed in with the rest of the product. The next time I used it was on freshly wash hair along with “Aunt Jackie’s Butter Creme Intensive Moisture Sealant” ( which is great btw). Long story short, it went on a lot easier with no flakes and my hair is SOOOO SOFT AND MOISTERIZED which NEVER happens often. my hair literally soaks EVERYTHING up no matter how much product I use unless I get really heavy handed with it which is annoying to do. (btw I have type 4a and 4b hair) I’m on day 3 without re applying and it’s still soft and well moisterized, I even left it out because it so happy with the results of my hair. it’s defined my curls well but it made it shrink ALOT but i wasn’t TOO bother by it. it did weigh my hair down a bit due to the heaviness but dried SO nicely, it’s great :)))))","April 26, 2018",Not Verified,3

I have a mix of 4b, 4c and a touch of 4a.  I ordered the sample product and loved it. I redordered the regular size and have been using this for about a month. It has flaked and the moisture is little to none.  In efforts of not waiting product or money, I'm tried to make it work.  I have noticed the less of other products used like a leave in conditioner, the less the flaking is.  Also, the flaking is horrible when I tried using it to twist my hair.

However I am using it daily and I have learned to only put it on the really dry areas which for me are my ends and right close to my scalp. For the initial application after a wash I put it all the way through the length of my hair.  I AM mixing it with another product (Profectiv Mega Growth Anti-Breakage Strengthener Creme)  With just the TGIN butter alone, my hair gets dull so the combo is working for now.  The TGIN Butter is really helping with my breakage and shedding issues.  I am African American and I cannot tell which number/letter of hair coarseness scale I have.  I have a tighter curl pattern (meaning frizz and dry) over most of my head with the middle of my head being almost like wire.  The ends of my hair are a little straight.  So would that be 3c/4...?

IMO (I am not a beautician or anything like that but this is just from my personal experience of the good, the bad, and the ugly of hair care products that don't do what they say they will do. Believe me when I say that I've ran across a lot of the ugly products on my journey).  The thing with any type of butter is to get the best effects from it IMO it needs to be used in addition to other products.  Butter is Oil and should be used like you would use your other oils which is to lock in moisture.  If I were to put just this on my hair it would end up being dry as a bone, and frizzy as heck- (LOL guess how I know), but if I use it in conjunction with other products it makes my hair look beautiful.I'm actually currently battling protein overload on over processed bleached hair (not from using this product but from not being educated enough on the proper moisture/protein balance prior to processing my hair, and then using way too many products containing protein on it following a 2 step protein treatment beforehand, so lol I have no one to blame there but myself.To correct my protein overload issue,  I'm only using protein based products 1x per week, and non protein based products the other 6 days per week. (My hair requires something either just water misting or some kind of product, oil or butter added to it daily or it will look horrible).  Because this contains protein, unfortunately, I at the current time am not using it daily, but if I could, I more than likely would.  For those of you who don't have protein issues with your hair this is a great daily product.Here is my current routine using this product: On my protein product days when a lot of protein is needed-(currently 1day per week), I use Ion Moisture on wet hair as a leave in conditioner, followed by One and Only Argon Oil 12-1 daily treatment, I comb those 2 products through my hair, and then lock those 2 moisture protein based products in by rubbing TGIN Butter Cream Daily Moisturizer into my hands, and patting it in small amounts over my entire hair.On my protein days that I only need a little protein-(which is determined by performing strand tests), but not a lot of protein like above, and want/need more moisture than protein, I use TGIN Green Tea Leave In conditioner-which is my favorite NON protein based leave in conditioner, followed by As I am so much moisture (I comb those 2 products through my hair), and then again pat my hair down with TGIN Butter Cream Daily Moisturizer (as applied above) to seal in those 2 moisturizing non protein based products).I have other variations of using both protein and non protein based products on their specific days, but all of them generally include either TGIN Green Tea Moisturizing Leave In Conditioner, and/or TGIN Butter Cream Daily Moisturizer.  TGIN Is a Great Product Line and I recommend it.","June 1, 2017",Not Verified,0

Very little of this goes a long way, especially for my tight coily hair. The more you use the more it clumps your curls together, but it will possibly flake.

I got it from Target. I would say that I am quite shock with this product. I am among the few ones who are having a rather weird experience with it. After washing my hair, when i apply this product, I do not experience any slip, any softness. On the contrary my hair feels gummy and brittle all at once. However I would experience the softness the next day.So does my hair take this long to absorb a product? I have high porosity, absorbing product is my hair's specialty. And yet,this product take about 12 hours before my experience any softness. And my hair does feel soft, I still experience breakage as when it is dry. To understand the root of it all, I did a little bit of examination of my broken strands and realized that this stuff only coats my hair. No penetration. NONE whatsoever.I am quite disappointed if you ask me. I am in this funk because SheaMoisture has changed the consistency (even formula) for Curl Enhancing Smoothie.I will not say ""do not buy"" because every hair is different, but I would not think of this product for a good suggestion.

Now I stopped using it because my skin is just too irritated.I did however note the difference between the 2 containers. The good one had a brown paper label surrounding the container and the one that didn't work so well had a black paper label.

SO here's an honest opinion from someone who paid for it on their own accord-I don't really like it. This product has great reviews everywhere, but it just isn't working for my low porosity/fine strands.SMELL: It's nothing like any other 'natural' product I've used-most tend to smell sweet, vanilla-y, herbal-y-this smells like more like chemicals, some will describe as 'fruity'-but think of the garnier fruictics 'green apple' type smell-it certainly isn't a bad smell, in my opinion, and it is not a strong or lingering smell, it's just different...CONSISTENCY: it is not too sticky tacky, but feels more like a custard, gel, or maybe a styling creme-feels like something that will give hold (which it doesn't give me much hold btw)-but this bothers me the most and it doesn't feel like it absorbs into my hair-it's definitely not an instant moisturizer.PERFORMANCE: I'm still on the fence for this-my hair feels 'soft' the next day after sleeping in this, but it's as if my hair is coated in softness andnot actually moisturized-I find that adding water helps it absorb betterI will keep trying and if my opinion changes I will come back and update, but so far I'm not a fan.","June 1, 2016",Not Verified,22

When I first used this product, I was disappointed with how thick it was and how it made my strands ""stringy"". Nevertheless, I used it in a twistout, slept in it, and took it down the next day.It was flake city.I was really disappointed that I'd just blown $16 on a product that just made my hair flake all over the place, and contemplated handing it off to someone else. Instead I just put it aside for the time being, and went back to the Cantu coconut curling cream and Shea Moisture's curl enhancing smoothie.After a while, I felt the urge to use the tgin moisturizer again, and went back on here to read some of the reviews, since it has a lot of positive ones. One of the reviewers said when they used the product they spritzed their hair with water first, used a dime sized amount, and then sealed with oil. I thought, why not try that? So I did, I spritzed my hair with water, used a dime sized amount, sealed with my shea butter mixture, and did a twistout.I'm happy to say, the results were amazing.My hair was totally moisturized, my curls were defined with a lot less frizz than usual and there were no flakes. NOT A SINGLE ONE. When you're using this product, a little goes a long way, since the consistency is so thick. If you have 3c or 4a curls this product might be a bit too thick for you, but if you've got 4c or combination 4b/4c curls like I do, this product might be just the thing you've been looking for.","April 15, 2016",Verified Purchase,12

BUT, it gets the job done.I went to sleep last night with no protective stying, just threw a scarf over my head. When I woke up this morning, all of the moisture was maintained. My hair wasn't dry and brittle like it usually is when I go to sleep like that.4 stars only because of the insane shrinkage. But that's not a huge deal because you can always combat that by combing it out a little (depending on the type of hair you have) or by sleeping with a protective style to stretch it out.I wouldn't recommend this for a wash and go if you don't like shrinkage. However, it's great if you're washing your hair the night before and plan to set it while you sleep. You won't be disappointed in the morning.I was not offered anything for this review.","March 14, 2016",Verified Purchase,49

Eveenntuuuually, the convenience of this line at my neighborhood Mariano's grocer, opened me up to trying another product - the honey miracle hair mask.  OMG, what a pleasant surprise!  So much so that I branched out to the rest of the TGIN hair care products. I've now officially tried, and am in love with, the full line ...because it's legit!The butter cream is an incredible moisturizer for this 4c girl.  And a little goes a very long way!  This is so rich that I could see it being easy to be heavy handed on this item if you've been using inferior hair products (unknowingly, like myself, until I found this).  My hair is straight outta black-Africa (I love love it), willful for sure, but once tamed a dream to rock out with. Tamed = moisturized properly/effectively. This product delivers. I rave about it to all my sistas. It leaves my 4c hair super soft, conditioned without being greasy and just overall happy.  My hair can, literally, go from dead-leaves-dry to supple and soft on this product.  It also does well with definition, and soft hold, in twist out styles from my experience.I am not a product junkie. I stumbled on this brand and am better for it.

"Acne Treatment Cream With Secret TEA TREE OIL Formula - Perfect For Fighting Breakouts, Spots, Cystic Acne, Acne Scar Removal - See Results in Days Without Dry Skin - by Keeva Organics (1oz)",do NOT use if you have chemical fragrance allergies,1.0,"I have persistent, stubborn cystic acne and thought I would try this product because it claims it is organic and treats cysts. I have a diagnosed chemical fragrance allergy and did not see fragrance or perfume apparently listed in the ingredients so thought I would try this product even though I try to stay within the confines of unscented prescribed acne products or hypoallergenic brands. I had the quickest and strongest allergic reaction I've had to any skincare product, which was full body itching, facial flushing, and asthma with facial application. Upon research I see that D-L menthol is chemically derived and part of the MilliporeSigma flavor and fragrance product line. I would not usually associate chemical scent with an organic product, only 100% essential oil-derived scent, so I feel like the naming of this product line is misleading. At least I now know to consider D menthol, L menthol, or D-L menthol an allergen when checking ingredients lists. For what it's worth, the cream has a nice texture and if you like mint and are not allergic to chemical fragrance, you'd probably enjoy the scent and tingle.","June 15, 2021",Not Verified,0

I had one pimple for a few weeks now. (Even Mario Badescu Drying Lotion couldn’t flatten it.) I put a small bit of this Keeva cream on it and the next morning it had shrunk.

Immediate results.,5.0,"My middle school  grandson came for a visit last month and I noticed a full acne breakout.  I could tell that he was upset about it so we researched treatment options.  I ordered this product first...and we applied it the day it arrived after a gentle cleaning using hydrogen peroxide.  There was a noticeable improvement after one night.  The inflammation was calmed and it looked like it was improving.  Today I saw him after one week and what had been a horrendous breakout was almost completely gone.  I realize this issue will require continued treatment to ensure that the problem has been resolved, and perhaps even a change in diet.  It is so difficult for adolescents to deal with a breakout on their own.  They just don’t know what to do or where to start.  It doesn’t go away on its own.

"Acne Treatment Cream With Secret TEA TREE OIL Formula - Perfect For Fighting Breakouts, Spots, Cystic Acne, Acne Scar Removal - See Results in Days Without Dry Skin - by Keeva Organics (1oz)",MOST HORRIBLE Choice I Ever Made for Myself!,1.0,"I don't usually write bad reviews, much less any reviews at all. But honestly, if I could give it ""0"" stars, I would. I bought it back in late October 2019 and immediately stopped into early November once I realize what it was doing to my skin. I didn't really want to write anything (but I am writing it in April and scrolled through my pictures I took of the progress of my face and saw how horrible my skin was at this time, so it brought my right back into how I was feeling and am still regretting it), and it really affected me for MONTHS afterward trying to fix the mess it made to my face, still fixing it to THIS DAY.I made a HORRIBLE choice by buying this product. I saw that it worked great for people, and after reading through BOTH good and bad reviews for an equal look at both sides of the argument (went to different websites to look at reviews as well, went to the company website to look at its reviews, and basically any review website for this product that I found because I was on the edge about this product), and after weighing the pros and cons of the reviews, I bought it. HORRIBLE DECISION.Its product says that it will sting for a bit and if it stings, it is working. I really liked the smell of it, so it didn't bother me, and its smell told me that it would sting as a result. HOWEVER, I used it sparingly. I used it probably only 2-3 times a week. I didn't change any of my other skin product so this was the only new thing I added into my routine. IT WAS HORRIBLE by the 2nd week. I thought it would get better after the first week but it continued, and one morning (3-4 weeks in) after putting it on overnight, I woke up and just saw how BAD, RED, FULL OF PIMPLES my skin (meaning my forehead, cheeks, chin, EVERYWHERE) has gotten. Literally, it GOT HORRIBLE OVERNIGHT. It was HORRIBLE. (Let me say, that it hasn't had this kind of effect AT ALL from previous use)I IMMEDIATELY STOPPED using it that day, and desperately tried to find a soothing moisturizer that would help this inflammation.I did not want to go out for days and stopped my volunteer activities for weeks. It was the WORST I have ever felt since middle school (hormone and rebellious age), and I am in my last year in college when this happened (so...about 9 years since middle school). I FELT HORRIBLE!But it had already happened, so all I could do was let it cool down with my moisturizer, cooling effects for sensitive skin, and staying with my routine again. It took MONTHS to heal, and I STILL have SCARS from it to TODAY that I am still remedying for to heal it.Honestly, all I can say is that it was the MOST HORRIBLE DECISION I have EVER made. I can't even say anything else about this. NEVER buying it again or anything from this company. Sorry, NOT sorry at all.","April 1, 2020",Verified Purchase,1

So I was ready to ditch it before trying.But since COVID19 is making everything financially tight, I figured I'd try it.I was very surprised that it moisturized so well! It's thin, but a little goes a long way! It started clearing up my skin in 2 days & seems to have prevented new breakouts! Surprisingly, no irritation from the salicylic acid, either!I'm actually thrilled and will be using this for my primary cream.*NOTE: This has more than a ""tingle"" but stops after about 30 to 60 seconds! You CANNOT use it around your eyes or close to your lips! I still use a separate, unmedicated moisturizer for eyes, above lip, and neck area. It doesn't have anti-wrinkle or firming ingredients that I'm aware of.*But I plan to reorder before my first jar runs out. Highly recommend! 💯","March 31, 2020",Not Verified,0

I've only used the lotion a few times. It doesn't seem to be a miracle, but possibly helps a bit. Some positives are that I have sensitive skin, and it is not drying like many acne treatments. Also, the smell is nice (unlike many acne treatments).**update**I really love this lotion, I just had to learn how to use it. I don't use it all over my face. I'm an adult who gets isolated acne, and I apply this to the acne spots on my face. There is a tingling sensation that follows (kind of like mouthwashin your mouth feeling). It does help dry up and clear up my acne spots. I can notice a difference after 1 or 2 days. I'd be a little afraid to use it on my whole face because it is drying, and I don't have widespread acne.

"Acne Treatment Cream With Secret TEA TREE OIL Formula - Perfect For Fighting Breakouts, Spots, Cystic Acne, Acne Scar Removal - See Results in Days Without Dry Skin - by Keeva Organics (1oz)",It is really working,5.0,"I started a mild hormonal acne and bumps on my laugh lines and chin after I stopped the birth control pills. My acne was different, it was enlarged pores that looked like small bumps and whiteheads. Accutane took care of it but it took 5 months of 40 mg to completely clear my chin. Then I listened to my stupid Dr. and used retinol cream on my chin while the Accutane was still in my system. It completely ruined my chin, I ended up with more deformed pores, cracked skin and lines on my chin. I had to go on two more round of Accutane again but every time, I stopped Accutane, those bumps came back with full force. Every website on internet encourages you to use retinol cream but some people like me are extremely sensitive to those creams and damage our skin permanently using retinol. God knows how many retinol serum I used just once or twice and added to the problems on my chin and laugh line. Two weeks ago, I started on Keeva organics with no hope, but the cooling sensation that starts 30 seconds after application, made me hopeful this will work and after two weeks, my skin is at least 40 percent improved. I see the bumps are getting smaller and those really small ones are gone. My large pores are beginning to smooth out. I will write another review after I see more improvements but so far so good. Anyone with skin problems should try this. Now, when I look at my skin with magnifying glasses, I'm not terrified anymore.","June 12, 2019",Not Verified,0

"Acne Treatment Cream With Secret TEA TREE OIL Formula - Perfect For Fighting Breakouts, Spots, Cystic Acne, Acne Scar Removal - See Results in Days Without Dry Skin - by Keeva Organics (1oz)",Helped to clear up my face,1.0,"** Original review **I used this product 2 times a day (in the afternoon and at night) from March 8, 2019, to April 8, 2019. When I first received this acne cream, I was immediately impressed with the packaging. The box and the container made the product look luxurious. I opened up the jar and it smelled amazing. The first time I put it on the acne on my face, I felt my face tingle. And, kinda funny but kinda gross, it popped all my acne. Other than that, I didn't notice a difference the first day. But I continued to use it. The acne cream was clearing up my current acne, and making it go away quickly, but I kept breaking out with new acne. So I did some research and started to take fish oil supplements in an attempt to balance out my oil production. That seemed to decrease the number of new breakouts. I continued to use the acne cream and take the fish oil. My next issue was that my face was inflamed. Unfortunately, the acne cream was not making the inflammation go away. I did some more research and found Thayer's Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera. I've been using the acne cream, the fish oil, and the witch hazel for a week, and have noticed a huge improvement with my face. It's not completely clear, but it's pretty darn close. Maybe I could have been patient and just used the acne cream for a month, but I've been dealing with major acne for about 6 months now. It's been affecting my ability to conduct business - I really just need it to go away asap! I will continue to use the three products together, and update my progress with pictures.** Updated review **Beware. I e-mailed Keeva about their free jar promo on 4/19 with the screen shot of my review. I did not receive a response. I e-mailed asking for an update on 4/27. Still no response.  I think 12 days is more than enough time to wait for a reply. Pretty shady to offer a promo and then not even answer your customers. I'm glad I didn't send pictures for a second free jar. They would probably use them and not send me anything.","April 11, 2019",Not Verified,1

I never had acne most of my life but I think after so stressful events and hormones, my skin just went crazy with the breakouts! Every day I was getting a new pimple, some were cystic and painful. I saw that this had really good reviews so I decided to try it out. I did take pictures of my face before I started using it so I can see if there was a difference and there was a huge improvement! I used it twice a day and my pimples definitely became less and less. However, I was still getting breakouts so I don't think this solved my problem completely. Also, the fact that some people receive fake products makes me cautious in purchasing again. I bought about 5 of these before deciding I was going to try something else.Maybe my breakouts were too severe for this product but I was happy with the improvements I did see. I would recommend buying this to see if it works for you but be careful with fakes.P.S. this a REAL review.

I would experience occasional pimples here and there but nothing serious. However recently I have noticed I've been getting more pinples than usual that would leave behind noticeable scars and dark spots. I was always use to having clear beautiful skin so I decided I needed to do something about my skin. That's when I came across Keeva Acne cream. This product is amazing and I love the fact that it has natural ingredients. Its light and creamy and good for everyday use. I love the minty smell. It has a tingly sensation after applying it to your face. I like that tea tree oil is used in this product. Tea tree oil has a lot of antibacterial and antifungal properties. I have been usuing Keeva for a while now. It is now my second month of using the acne cream and I have noticed a difference and change in my skin. I dont have any new pimples or blackheads, my complexion is clear. My skin has cleared up tremendously. I also changed my diet to keto, started working out and drinking plenty of water everyday.

I have always had reasonably clear skin, until a few months ago.  Since I haven't grown accustomed to having acne, I was not taking it well.  I would get breakouts mostly on my jawline and neck, however, they seemed to take a rather long time to clear up.  I started picking at the acne, which only made matters worse.  I decided I couldn't take it anymore.  I started to do some research online to see if I could find an effective product that didn't cost a ton of money.  I can't remember what websites I looked at exactly, but I did find one where Keeva 7X Faster Acne Treatment Cream was denoted as being the most effective product, albeit not the most widely sold.  I looked into the product and found that it was affordable.  I purchased the 1 oz. jar as a trial sample to see if I saw any improvement in the appearance of my skin.  Since using Keeva, my skin looks smoother and I am not having breakouts nearly as frequently as I was before.  My trial bottle that I purchased was running low, so I purchased the larger bottle.  I have a feeling I will be using the product for a long time.  Thank you Keeva for making an effective acne treatment product that is reasonably affordable.","January 6, 2019",Verified Purchase,4

After using for about a week, I knew that this was the original formula. I continued to use it for 4+ weeks to be sure, and I can say, without a doubt, that this is the original formula I was used to.  I have changed my rating from 1 star to 5, due to the quality of the product and the fact that the Keeva reps stepped in and made things right.  I would now HIGHLY recommend this product, as it has dramatically improved my rosacea!EDIT 2:  As of today, 2/11/19 I have not received anything from Keeva.  The 2oz jar of their original formula that was supposed to be shipped ""right away"" (see comments for the response from a Keeva rep) never materialized.  It's really a shame, as I was hoping to try the original formula again.EDIT:  A representative from Keeva has responded to my review, and she explained that their product has become a victim of fakes using their name.  Happily, she told me they will be sending me a replacement of their original product.  Once I receive it, I will update my review after I've tried it out for a week or so.Before my last order of Keeva I would have given this product 5 stars.  It did wonders for my rosacea, and I absolutely loved it. However, my last order was NOT the same product, and I immediately began having bad flare ups of my rosacea. It just kept getting worse, so I remembered that I still had the original box and decided to see if they had changed the formula.As you can see in the photos, in the old formula, tea tree oil was listed as the first of only 5 main ingredients.  In the new formula, salicylic acid is the main ingredient, and tea tree oil is the 18th ingredient listed under ""Inactive Ingredients""!  The old formula also states that it was made in the USA, while the new formula clearly says it is made in China.  The new box also no longer makes the claims of being paraben free, non-gmo, or not tested on animals.The description on this Amazon page (as of today 12/5/18) lists tea tree oil as the 2nd ingredient, under ""Natural Proprietary Ingredients"".Based on results and the packaging I received, this new formula is nothing like the old one. If you're looking for a true tea tree oil acne cream, I'm sad to say this is no longer a good option.","December 5, 2018",Verified Purchase,164

She simply puts a layer on her face every night after her shower and she has had tremendous improvements to her complexion.  We were recently at the pediatrician who had previously given her a prescription cream for her face.  The Dr. looked at her clear skin and immediately asked what we had been doing.  We told her that we had been using Keeva tea tree cream and she said, ""keep doing it"".  We recently also bought some for my other daughter who struggles with bumps on the backs of her arms which she has picked at and caused scars.

I was super concerned about toxins/chemicals and loved that this was made with pure, organic, high quality ingredients.  That said, I also demand efficacy with anything I put on my face and this just works.  I have extremely sensitive skin and this doesn't irritate or overdry.  It reduces inflammation and acne immediately.  I always have a spare jar now in my bathroom so I am never without.I did try another organic tea tree brand on Amazon because it was slightly less expensive and I broke out so horribly I immediately sent it back and went back to Keeva.As my husband calls anything that you know works consistently a 7 iron, this cream is a 7 iron.

I came across it when I was looking for different acne medications when my acne got VERY bad. I started incorporating this product into my skincare routine and I am loving the results. I started using this cream about a month and a half ago, and I have seen a huge difference in my skin. I wash my face twice daily morning and night, and I am running pretty low and will need to purchase more soon. It is a bit pricey, but for how well it works, I am willing to pay. I love this cream so much because it moisturizes and cleanses at the same time. It feels so nice on my face as well. It is so much better than the creams from the drug store that simply dry out my face. Attached are some progress pictures, the first one from August 24th, and the second one from this morning. I still have a ways to go before my skin has fully cleared, but this cream is certainly helping.","October 12, 2018",Verified Purchase,8

I am a 26 year old female and have never had issues with acne until the last couple of years. Either due to hormonal changes or stress. I have tried enough products but never tried any of those expensive regimen packages. When I found this at a reasonable price and a more natural product, I had to try it! My skin has been much more clear and very smooth! I wanted to write this review, as I rely on reviews when I am looking to purchase a new product. One thing that did alarm me a little, is the initial tingling effect it has on your skin but I have never had a reaction to it. I apply twice a day, morning and night!

So...I’m going to try and rush through this 🙈. But... THE PRODUCTS ARE AMAZING!!! I use the Acne Treatment Cream along with the 7x Faster Tea Tree Oil Acne Treatment, OMG!!!My spouse purchased Keeva for me because my face was breaking out and full of blemishes. Honestly, I was completely skeptical about using it because my spouse has never purchased anything like this before, and I figured it wasn’t going to work anyway. But immediately upon using it I was hooked and so was my oldest daughter.Did I mention how AMAZING these products are, Lol? Seriously, I kid you not. They are amazing!!!!  They are lightweight. You don’t have to use a lot. A little goes a long way. The products are not greasy, feels amazing, feels refreshing, smell amazing, and most importantly they work.I was literally that individual who would not leave the house without makeup. If I was rushing and forget I would go back home to get my makeup or stop at the nearest store to purchase makeup. But now that story is completely different thanks to Keeva. My blemishes have cleared drastically. I go out without makeup, and I haven’t experienced any breakouts.I was so pleased with these products that I personally started placing the orders myself. I did notice that they tend to sell quickly, so I purchased a few bottles to last until my next purchase.I personally hate taking pictures, so in the picture is my oldest daughter. She does not have on any makeup except lipstick in one picture. But her skin looks gorgeous.  Keeva is amazing, I’m telling you. Try it for yourself and see.

I was hoping this cream would not only keep pimples away but to fade the acne marks too. I continue to use this cream hoping to see a satisfying turn around. I just started to use the acne scar cream. I don't want to give up, only because from what I understand about tea tree oil, it doesn't harm skin the way other acne products do.

I decided to do some background research and it came back with positive results. I decided to give it a shot.I do regularly wash and use a cleaning wipe for my face to remove dirt/oil. I do it once in the morning then once at night. After cleaning my face at night I apply a product if any before bed. However, I did this regardless of using a product or not. So all I did was include the Keeva organics cream into my routine.After 1 week - 2 weeks of consistent use I had noticed that I had not had a cystic acne breakout in a while. This continued through my use of the product. I had even noticed that If i was starting to get a breakout and applied a little extra to that location it would significantly reduce redness and inflammation.

I am 36 yrs old and was dealing with uncontrollable acne on my chin area, with some acne on other areas of my face too.  The acne was mostly cystic and therefore really hard to deal with- impossible to cover up and takes forever to heal.  This product definitely really helps- I have only dealt with a couple bad zits recently and they heal within a few days, instead of weeks.  My skin is also really smooth and soft feeling, whereas it used to feel bumpy and dry.  I love that it is a one step process- just this lotion and that's it.  I was hoping for total elimination of my problem, but this product helps more than any other I've used, so I'll keep using it!","August 4, 2018",Not Verified,3

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Just okay,3.0,"These are fine for work which is what I use them for. I don't go to the gym with them or on walks or anything.  I use these mostly to chime into virtual meetings so I can't comment much on sound quality.  They were easy to pair to my laptop and are relatively user-friendly. The noise-canceling is almost non-existent. The noise-canceling is like wearing a winter hat that goes over your ears which is to say that the noise-canceling does not do much at all.When you turn the headphones on, a little robot voice tells you how much battery is left. That is, she'll tell you how much battery is left at every ~20-~30% interval. Fresh out of the box, these were charged at 100%. A day or so later, the battery dropped to 70% which I thought was weird. Then the next few days it then dropped to 50%.... you get the idea. In short, why have a battery level announcement at power on if the information isn't completely accurate?TLDR: These are just okay.

I have only had them roughly a little over a month and a half, they have been fantastic, better than what I had expected.

The first set lasted nearly 2 years before the puppy, in a brief moment of being unsupervised, chewed it up. I had no trouble at all with that pair. The second pair had bluetooth issues from the start. It would usually take a good 30 seconds to connect after turning it on. Occasionally I'd get lucky and it would be less than 10. And then one day the bluetooth just quit. It wouldn't connect at all. I tried to unpair and pair it up again and it won't do that either.

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Excellent headphones for the price,5.0,"These headphones have great sound for the price, good bass,  present mids and clear highs. Comparing them to their bigger brother (WH-XB700) which I use all the time, they are slightly clearer in the high end, but don't have quite as much bass as the 700s.  They paired easily with an old Samsung TV. Simple to set up.  The only thing I would hold against them is that if you have a small to average sized head, then they should fit just fine, but if you have a larger than average head, these might be a little tight. I don't use the noise cancellation feature as it messes up the sound on all headphones. I would definitely recommend these if you want exercise headphones that stay on, or like me you can't find earbuds that stay in your ears, then these sonys are great.  By the way, comparing them to beats earbuds, the beats have a more colored sound (bassy and not so clear in the top end of the spectrum).

It’s much safer because there is no noise reduction. No one in real life has absolutely zero noise in the background. There is almost always something. So, if you hear something, like a bunch of bicyclists coming behind you, you can be cautious. If it were unnaturally silent, you could be oblivious and get hit, or worse! Bluetooth pairs very easily.

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",I can hear !,5.0,"So one of the biggest problems with hearing is phase distortion. Let's say the sound comes at you from the TV but sound waves are also projected at the wall, ceiling and floor. The sounds arrive at your ear at different times; hence the phase distortion. If you live in a padded cell you got it made(at least sound wise) otherwise there's the potential for problems. The human ear is very sensitive to phase distortion so with my lousy hearing exasperated by this phase problem I can all but eliminate it with the headphones. The Bluetooth connects easily, especially to my S20+ but TVs can be a little more annoying. That's why I'm studying Korean. As far as music goes Frank Sinatra sounded pretty good playing music through my phone. As far as quality goes ... well, I failed music appreciation class in Grammer School !","February 28, 2022",Verified Purchase,0

Not sure if i just have a bad set, or if this is a defect which would indicate why they are Sony product at such a good price...  If it's ""really"" cold, the bluetooth connection becomes choppy on my end--meaning, if i'm listening to music while shoveling snow, the sound becomes very choppy in the playback.  I've also witnessed them disconnect from the phone for no reason (they usually reconnect in  a  few seconds, but, something ain't right!  lol  But, the sound is great, and for playing music, they're awesome.","February 22, 2022",Verified Purchase,0

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black","Great sound, very sensitive mic",4.0,"As expected, the sound quality on these headphones is great, even at the $50 price. Sony doesn't need to use gimmicks such as bass boost or weights in the ear cups to give you incredible sound in a small package. Additionally, while they do lack a bit of that premium feel compared to my mainstay Sennheiser HS280 Pros, they have so far shown themselves to handle well on multiple flights per month since purchase. The ear cups are a bit small for my ears (which are themselves small) but that also doesn't detract.Where these headphones lack is the mic sensitivity. The mic on these is very sensitive and are prone to clipping very easily. Early on, I tried using these for phone calls with clients and employees and I've gotten feedback that there is a lot of clipping. I also don't really like that they pipe in a bit of mic into the audio stream when the application you are using makes use of the mic. I so far found no intuitive way to lower the mic sensitivity.Finally, while the battery life on these is bonkers (I've so far gone a month without charging), when you do charge you can't use them. And if you are using them, you can't charge. You have turn off the headphones to charge which kinda sucks.Still, I'm giving these headphones 4 stars simply because they are still solid Sony bluetooth headphones and I'm convinced they have the build quality to last for many years. Maybe even longer than my Sennheisers.","February 21, 2022",Verified Purchase,0

Even at the full $58 price, I'd say its worth it.I kept buying earbuds because I couldnt always use my galaxy buds on my PC, since 6hr battery life.Earbuds kept breaking down, kept wasting $10-15 on each new earbud.So I finally bought some wireless headphones. These are pretty amazing. Comfortable, don't hurt and aren't tight, the sound is amazing. Plus the volume control is very easy, just press up or down, like a phone's volume button. The battery life is also crazy. Sometimes I accidentally leave them on, because your supposed to power them off. It still stayed at 70% when I used them again. Charging them is also fast, they charge quick, even better for all the battery life it provides.Also simple to use. Just got to hold the power button for 2 seconds and it says ""Power on"" and it tellsyou what the battery % is at, like ""Battery at 70%"". Pretty nice. Again, a voice ""Power off"" when youpress it again. My galaxy buds probably last 6hrs, if you use these headphones continually I can totally see them lasting 12 hours. Have not used the mic much, but connected to your phone and taking phone calls is perfectly fine. Only heard some weird audio sound as I used these on a zoom call, but everything else is spot on. I'd buy them again, never have to waste money on any other wired headphone/earbud. Quality over quantity.","January 11, 2022",Verified Purchase,0

Not sure if that's true or not, but they have never run out of power.The sound quality is o.k.  Does the job, but no better than my old cheapie Chinese ones that broke.

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Skip these ugh. Horrible for phone calls,1.0,"I honestly think many of these 5-star reviews are fake.I thought Sony would be pretty decent quality. I bought these to replace a regular pair of cheapo $19.95 Bluetooth headphones (cracked the headband part after a year of OK use), expecting a slight upgrade. I also have Apple air pods, some knock-off air pods, Jabra earpieces, and Beats by Dre headphones I’ve had for a few years. So I’m pretty into headphones.Of course these don’t stack up to $200+ headphones… but they’re not even as good as $20 headphones.Cons:-Expensive for poor quality in calls-Painful on the ears, after 20 min. The earmuff part is too small. It’s also tight, and not enough padding to offset the poor ergonomics of it. I have an average-sized adult female head. They would only be comfortable if you only wear them for a short time, like 30 min a day.-Impossible to use for phone calls, due to the super awful “echo feedback.” I could hear myself breathing, loudly, as it was magnifying sound on the mix and feeding it back in my ears. All my words echoed back at me. I looked up how to change this, and it can’t be changed. Said move mic further away” which is impossible to do while wearing the headphones.-I called my friend, who reported the audio quality wasn’t good and didn’t sound right. The feedback was so much I could only talk a minute.Pros:-Cheap looking and plain. Nobody will want to steal them from you!-The earpieces swivel, I guess that’s good?-Stay on your head well. I could do sit-ups or bend over and they don’t move. I like snug fit in headphones.-Not to big or heavy-Sound quality is just ok, but not worth fifty bucks or so, considering you can’t make a phone call and they hurt.-I didn’t get them expecting noise cancellation, so no comment on that. They don’t have that.-can’t comment on durability as I am returning them.","November 6, 2021",Verified Purchase,1

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Fantastic headphones!,5.0,"The CH510s are fantastic headphones. Here are a few pros:- Extremely low-profile and lightweight. It doesn't look like military-grade earmuffs!- Audio quality is fantastic for the price. Not as good as some of the other earphones out there (like the XM4s), however the audio is crisp and you can hear clearly.- The ear cups are adjustable, which makes it easier to store in a case or otherwise have it take up less space.- No leakage at all. Even from ~2/3ft away, no one was able to hear my music playing.There were two things that really bothering me. First off, I'm used to headphones with aptX (thus, low latency), and the CH510s are quite a departure from that. I've noticed quite a bit of latency whilst using them, although it doesn't bother me too much. Another thing that bothered me was the ear cups. After about two or three hours of use, it can start to make your earlobes uncomfortable.

When you first see them they look kiinda basic and cheap looking and the first thing I thought was how deep could the Bass be? They're so small.  I was surrrrrprised. The bass what not only deep it was rich. I could hear subtle deep background sounds I couldn't even hear at all from my Bravia T.V. speakers. They don't always connect the first time but they do always connect.  I don't claim to know how the noise cancellation works but I have an air conditioner that blasts loudly and I can only hear it when there's a silence between commercials..  They're just a little tight and the sound doesn't go up as high as I want it, but it's acceptable for me. If I had a do-over I would have gotten an over ear model rather than on ear.

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Great sound but Bad  echo,3.0,"Headphones are a great value and the sounds is great,  the only issue is a echo from the Mic.  I also haven't been able to identify a way to mute the mic.  I mute via application (zoom/MS teams) but while your muted you still get feedback from the mic so you feel like you are not muted.the automated voice you hear when you power on the headset is nice and gives you a update on how much power you have left.I'd recommend for just audio only.

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black","As pure headphones, great! As a headset, hot trash.",3.0,"I purchased these in summer of 2020, and they held up nicely until one the sound started to give out on the left side -- probably due to me throwing it straight in my backpack on trips without any case.As some other users have mentioned, the sound is INCREDIBLE for the price, but see my caveat below. The battery life was the most impressive feature. I could go for hours and hours before even getting down to 70% battery.A huge con was the echo feature when on calls or using the microphone -- what I mean is that you can hear yourself talking and any ambient noise around you being repeated through the speakers, with seemingly no way to turn it off. (In other words, you're hearing what's coming through the microphone, mixed in with any other audio.) Additionally, in this mode, the audio quality on a call from the other end takes a serious hit. (Full disclosure: I do still use the headphones for discord calls or when streaming, but I've just gotten used to the echo/talkback. This is exclusively because I'm too cheap to buy a new pair yet.)I would say these headphones are perfect for someone who just wants to listen to music or podcasts, but they are hot trash whenever used on a call. I'd also recommend getting a case or keeping them in a safe place when not in use, as they are kind of fragile. For pure headphones purposes, they're a great price. But as a headset, you could do way better.","June 12, 2021",Verified Purchase,1

I didn't bother trying the sound out because I knew I wasn't going to keep them so I don't have a review on the sound quality.Also, the earphones (over the ears) were small but I have a small head and smaller ears so that wasn't a problem for me.

I borderline hate these headphones lol they are way too big and start sliding off my head if I so much as glance in a slightly downward angle. Constantly having to adjust them every time I move. The sound quality is honestly terrible. I didn’t even realize how bad it was until I was listening to some amateur music online and remarking that several of the artists were so terrible that I couldn’t even understand anything they were saying. Then I took them off and listened through my iPhone speakers and suddenly could hear them just fine. The low end balance is waaaay too high. Not like, bass boosted, just very poor EQ. And don’t even think about attempting to have a phone call with them. My friend literally hung up on me because she couldn’t understand me and the sound was hurting her ears. I gave them 2 stars because they are technically functional and the price is great. But again, you definitely get what you pay for with these. I’ve had them for a few months and at first tried to be positive and make lemonade out of lemons but to be 100% honest I’m not even sure I trust the Sony brand anymore after this.

With this brand? are you kidding me? my old one was a Logitech, it lasted 6 year and still working. only reason I had to get this Sony one is because the Logitech one does not have much battery time. otherwise, it's working very nice. it is a shame, this product I purchased only lasted less than 1/10 of the life of my old headset. not to mention, it is extremely slow when you first turn it on before it's connected to your smart device and ready to use. on the other hand, my Logitech one takes no time: you simply switch the button to turn it on and next thing is it's connected and ready to use. This Sony one somehow has to make a statement after turned on saying ''power...on....battery...fully...charged"" in a unbearable slow speed. I mean, are you kidding me? I'm not dumb, I don't need a device to tell me ""it's power on and Bluetooth is connected"". For god's sake, save the time since when I turn it on I need to use it, not wait for a 10second responding and statement to state the obvious fact.Once again, very very disappointed. and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT","February 19, 2021",Verified Purchase,2

The feature feeds back some of your ambient noise into your headset (as a safety feature?) but it ruins any hope at audio quality. The clacking of a keyboard, someone talking two rooms away-- they come through crisply on your headset.Sony advertises this as a Feature and says it can't be disabled. Ruins the whole deal. Don't buy.Sometimes the headset connects to a computer in some mode that doesn't have SideTone, but I can't figure out how to control this. On my Pixel 2, SideTone makes phone calls almost impossible to follow, especially if you're outside. Wind, footsteps, cars, your own voice -- all feed back into your ears.

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Did I Get A Bad Set? (Honest Review),3.0,"I am an Sony disciple, having used products since the '70s. With over 10k reviews highly-rating this product, I was excited to try them out. But I can't make these headphones do the simplest of things of which I would expect a Bluetooth-connected product to do: maintain connectivity and produce quality sound.When they do work, the sound quality is exactly what I would expect from a Sony product: responsive, crisp, and clean with excellent dynamic range. But the Bluetooth seems to be the problem with this set.I'm using an ASUS USB 3.0 BT-400 Bluetooth adapter connected to a static, immobile PC that works wonderfully for my MEE AF-32s as well as my Motorola S9-HDs, at a range of 3-20 feet. I had no problems with either of those devices, but these Sonys will not stop skipping audio.  And by skipping, I mean no more than 3-10 seconds of audio before a 1-10 second break. Imagine watching an episode of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" and muting the laugh tracks. Yeah, that bad.I disabled all the extra features that I could find, ensured no other applications were running, rebooted several times and did all the disconnects/re-pairings I could handle, but I can not get these headphones to stop skipping. And Sony's best recommendation is to move away from my Wi-Fi connection. Hmm.edit: I connected to my mobile and they seemed to work flawlessly, so there may just be a compatibility problem with my ASUS wireless adapter. Will try others. Upgraded from 1 to 3 stars.That, along with the flimsy-feel to the build as well as the inconvenient placement of the controls very much disappoints me as a Sony enthusiast. For the price, those other nuances are acceptable. But headphones are all about sound and, with the constant skipping, this excludes these Sony headphones from that category.","February 9, 2021",Verified Purchase,0

She wears these headphones for a majority of the day  everyday and is either teaching, in class, or studying. She absolutely loves them!  Her exact words were, ""These headphones block out so much noise and have great battery life, not to mention so comfortable. They have been a lifesaver for working at home!""

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Amazing for the price (on sale),5.0,"I got these on sale since I wanted a pair of cheap Bluetooth headphones and a review on another pair I was looking at said to get these at this price for performance. They are just plain looking headphones, the black ones I got just look normal and not bright and flashy with designs just standard black headphones. They do clamp tight to your head, my ears hurt after a couple of hours of use but I use them for work where I have to bend down and pivot a lot and they don’t budge an inch so they are awesome for that. The ratchet that it uses to adjust the headphones seems like it might break easily so be careful if you adjust them just be gentle. The sound is really nice I didn’t know what to expect. The range is also pretty good as well since I don’t keep my phone in my pocket to make sure it doesn’t get damaged I put it near where I work so that’s a major plus. The bass is also good too, I’ve never had a pair of Bluetooth headphones before but the sound and volume is great. Type C charging is standard and the battery life is excellent. The buttons for volume up is fine but volume down is a little hard for me to find without a distinct nub so sometimes I end up turning them off on accident. The headphones also tell you the battery life when you turn them on and give a low battery warning as well. Seeking tracks will give you a chime to let you know it is seeking which I’ve grown to like as a feature. I haven’t tried using the mic with Siri or anything like that. It activated on accident once but never again. These headphones are really incredibly good for what they are, comfort wise I wouldn’t recommend unless you just really want music like I did and you need headphones that stay in place.","January 7, 2021",Verified Purchase,1

I could literally hear myself typing in the headphones. No thanks!From Sony's website:When on a call, my voice sounds loud or echoes.When making or receiving a call using your headphones, your voice and other sounds are picked up via the headphone microphone Sidetone function. Your voice and the surrounding sounds will all be picked up through the headphone earpieces. Hearing them is not a malfunction.NOTE:The volume level and sensitivity of the Sidetone function cannot be adjusted, and the function cannot be turned off.When using the headphone microphone, make sure that it is not too close to your mouth.

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Decent budget invesment,5.0,"I've owned these for a little over a month now and have gotten some time to make some deductions...Reason for purchase - my day to day headphones are AirPods, which I love. I own an Apple TV, and wanted some overhead headphones to pair for movies, especially at night, to avoid disturbing my neighbors. At first, I wanted one of the more expensive headphones (like the Beats or even higher priced Sonys) but wasn't ready to pay so much for something I'm not even using frequently.Pros -These are nice and light, with swiveling ear pieces. The battery life is great (35+ hours on one charge) - I have yet to charge them honestly! As soon as you turn it on, there's a voice indicating the battery percentage which is great. The sound quality is pretty good considering the price, though I'm sure there is better (no noise cancelling capabilities). The Bluetooth is 5.0 so the connectivity is reliable, works well in range, and more importantly helps maximize the battery life. I honestly connect it to my Apple TV and forget I'm not near the TV as I roam around my apartment. I love the simplicity of the cups design, just the logo.Cons -During ongoing phone calls, it's hard to ignore the light echo of your own voice. I can also faintly hear my footsteps while walking around my neighborhood, which could made these challenging to use in a busier setting like a city. The ear cups create a nice suction, but after a few hours, especially with my earrings, my earlobes get a little sore or just feel pressed. There are only 3 buttons on the right cup (skip - power/play - rewind); for some reason (might just be me), since I have it paired to more than one device (in my case my phone and my apple tv), I can't quite figure out how to make it ""discoverable"" without disabling my Bluetooth on the previously connected device.In spite of the cons, for the price, I am satisfied with this purchase. I probably would use these to travel via plane BUT with no headphone jack, (depending on the airline company) I'd be limited to wireless on my personal devices. Sony is a great company that makes reliable products, so I anticipate they'll last for a while.","December 10, 2020",Verified Purchase,1

After googling around about it there is some sort of feature which amplifies the sound around you into your own headphones and, here is the kicker, there is literally no way to turn it off. Sony knows it's there, it's a listed feature, and you can't turn it off even though it's horrible.They seem fine for normal music listening but seriously do not recommend for phone use.","December 10, 2020",Verified Purchase,0

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Great sounds but it is not suitable for making calls and Sony's app is useless,3.0,"I received these headphones as a gift so I did not directly purchase them. I was going to use these headphones for phone calls and Zoom meetings as I work from home. Unfortunately, call quality is among the worst I've ever experienced in wireless headphones. I feel cheap Skullcandy wireless headphones you can get at Walmart for $10 have better call quality and these headphones are certainly surpassed in call quality by many competitors. When I make calls, the headphones amplify my own background noise such as when I move and click my mouse, type on my keyboard, or if the AC is on. The headphones will blast ambient noise around me loud and clear but I cannot hear the person I called very well. The callers have told me they can hear my ambient sound loud and clear but my voice is faint. Did Sony misalign the microphone so it can pick up ambient sound instead of the user's voice? It's such a strange experience I have never felt before.While it disappoints during phone calls, it makes up for in sound quality and connectivity. The sound quality is quite impressive for the price. It delivers a punchy bassline while delivering clarity. They are quite loud but the sound quality is consistent at all volume levels. It does not sound tinny when I turn the volume up. The headphones are light and comfortable around the ears as the earpieces have comfortable cushions that feel like good quality. The quality of the plastic leaves much to be desired but for the price it is acceptable.These headphones are designed for listening to music for long periods of time. You can take them out on runs or long walks or perhaps the gyms if they are ever safe again. Perhaps these will be great for children, teens, and young adults who want to listen to music for long periods of time while they study.Lastly, let's talk about the app. The app is actually useless because it will not connect to your headphones regardless of which operating system you use. On iOS, it will make you wait endlessly as it attempts to search for your Sony headphones. On Android, it literally does nothing. I put my Sony headphones in pairing mode and I open the Andriod app. Instead, the app tells me to open my system settings to pair and includes a link. The link opens the Bluetooth settings in your phone where you can pair your headphones. I pair the headphones and I go back into the app but it keeps displaying the message stating to open my system settings to pair. I restarted the app but it still displays the same message.","December 8, 2020",Not Verified,1

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black","Great headphones, absolutely awful for any sort of voice communication",1.0,"Got these headphones for my girlfriend and while the headset itself is great, there's a ""feature"" built into the headset that cannot be turned off called ""sidetone"". This sidetone feature plays your voice back to you while you're talking when it detects that the mic can be in use (such as Discord and an actual phone call). You get great sound quality up until you try to talk to someone else, and with the two of us having lots of distance between us, a headset that makes communications easy and simple is necessary more than ever. The fact that this cannot be turned off through a hardware switch or through a software option is an absolute deal breaker, and the fact that this ""feature"" is missing from anywhere on the product page to make an informed decision before purchase.If you're after a good headset and never plan to use its microphone, these would probably be worthwhile, but if you want a nice pair of headphones that you don't have to talk over your own voice with, then you will want to avoid these at all costs.","December 4, 2020",Verified Purchase,11

They look nice and they are very light on my head. They are comfortable. I’ve used many Bluetooth headphones over the years and these have the best pairing, next to AirPods. They pair quickly and consistently. The power-up tones are pleasant and not too loud. I really like the voice that greets me and updates me on pairing and battery life. The battery life is great! I can go all day, sometimes two without charging. No one has complained about my microphone. The only thing that brings it down is the sound quality. I’d put these on the same level as the bus that came with my phone. They do sound good, but, they don’t compare to the fullness and detail of more expensive headphones. But, that’s $40 vs $100+. I’d highly recommend these for meetings, or doing chores around the house.","December 4, 2020",Verified Purchase,0

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Great mid priced headphones,5.0,"When I look for headphones, sony is a brand I always go for. I had the older model of these for years until they finally died so I decided to just get more of the same since they worked so well for me. These new ones work just as well! I'm not an audiophile so I couldn't tell you if the music doesn't have enough range. I personally don't like extra bass so these are perfect because they offer, what I consider to be a nice balanced sound. Not too low not too high. They were easy to set up and pair.The only annoying thing is that they have a voice instead of beeps to tell you when it's on or off and what the battery life is. I don't like her saying ""battery about 70 percent"" when I turn them on. I like that it tells me the battery level but it's an odd, overly wordy sentence that could have been shortened. The battery life is okay, not great. And the cord that comes with them is only 3 inches!!  Since it's usb-C I don't have any other cords for it without buying a new one.  It would have been nice to have at least a foot or two to plug these in for charging.

It certainly isn't going to be able to compete with the high dollar wireless headphones but for this price, it's worth it. Quality of sound is good. Sound canceling is alright. Like, it muffles the sound around you enough where you can just turn up the volume and it will drown it out. Construction quality is not too bad. It can handle being dropped or sat on and won't break. It charges via USB type C so that makes it easier to charge. Don't need a different charger than the one for your phone. Battery life is pretty good. It will last about 12 to 14 hours at continuous use at half volume. Not ideal for working out as it does not hold onto you very well without being uncomfortable.

Sound is very clear  3. I can control the sound with my remote when connected to my TV.  Many other headphones will give you slightly low volume and then no volume at all.

Since the microphone is built into one of the earphones, the sound on the other callers end when you speak is not great. And the mic picks up on the other caller’s audio from your end. So, they hear unpleasant amplified noise and delay. The microphone also only works for calls and nothing else.

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Excellent sound quality and comfort for a lower Sony price.,5.0,"These have EXCELLENT sound quality, despite being a lower-priced Sony. They do not cancel noise, but DO significantly reduce it. I like being somewhat aware of my surroundings, able to respond if need be. They are very lightweight, with very comfortable ear pads made of soft, cushioned leather that provide a good seal. I think the reviewers that said they’d be better for children might have been expecting over-the-ear pads rather than on-the-ear pads. The Bluetooth connection works flawlessly. There is even a pleasant automated voice that announces when the headphones are on or off, and also announces amount of battery charge. These headphones have long battery life. And of course, everyone who has wireless audio knows how convenient it is to not have to be attached to your device by a cord. I also appreciate the simplicity of the control buttons on the unit.

You can hear your own voice when taking a call - this is the biggest drawback. A very unexpected one, but one you can get used to. The volume could be just one step higher. Yet, I think that build quality is great, the sound picture is very good. I have a pair of HD66x and sony are about as enjoyable sound-wise, but don't go as loud and are nowhere near in terms of comfort.These are decent headphones for 40$. Not the best! Taking a call in those is as painful to you as it is to your buddy (bluetooth headphones ain't good to your buddy on android whatever you do). The sound quality is good. Not the most even, not great, but for bluetooth headphones it is actually awesome, I have no complains. It is way better than Dr.Dre-like sound image of more expensive Sony models. I got used to the call echo. I found a way to put it on my head and not experience pain. I enjoy the sound. The volume is not high enough sometimes.

Nothing against the seller, the shipping was fast. First, the good - they’re fairly light & comfortable, easy to charge, long battery life & pairs easily with my iPhone. The sound quality is decent- not great, not terrible. But the problem is the microphone. It is so sensitive it picks up every sound in the room, THEN FEEDS IT BACK INTO THE EARPHONES. When I’m on a conference call, if the girl at the desk 12’ away speaks or even shuffles papers, the noise drowns out everything else on the call. If she speaks, I have to mute my phone or leave the room or her conversation will be heard by everyone in the line, just as if she were on the call. That’s how overly sensitive the mic is.

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Excellent sound/quality value,4.0,"Even though I've only used the Sony WH-CH510 for a few days I've found them to be vastly under-rated by most reviews I've seen or read. Their sound is satisfying and substantial in the bass and mid-tones. Perhaps they do not have the extreme crispness in the treble of the very best, but then again I do not typically buy $350 headphones.  I have compared their sound quality to headphones in the $50 to $120 price range and they do sustain their value. I have not been disappointed in their performance.  I purchased these Sony headphones to use with a Samsung tv that did not have a 3.5mm output jack, only an Optical Audio Out. In order to do so I paired the Sony WH-CH510 with the Avantree TC417 Bluetooth Transmitter Receiver, and they have worked perfectly.  I listened to the Sony WH-CH510 via bluetooth sound from that Samsung tv set, as well as an iPhone, and iPad. I've compare their Bluetooth sound quality to wired headphones and while there is a tiny bit of a difference it is extremely minor. In fact I would say you would have to listen very hard to find a difference.  When you first pick up the Sony WH-CH510 they feel very light and insubstantial. You could say cheap, but looking at the construction quality all I can see is a weight savings; no metal, only plastics. That makes them very portable. How long they will last depends on the kind of heavy use you put them through and the care taken. The problem is that to substantially increased the build/sound quality of these Sony headphones you would have to upgrade to the WH-CH700n ($200). That is quite the difference in price.","September 27, 2020",Not Verified,0

The sound quality is noticeably better than the $20 wired headphones we had been using.  We charged each one once and two weeks later they are all still going after 3-4 hours use each day.  The embedded microphone (no separate boom) generates no comment from our on-line meeting partners which we take to indicate that it works well.  We chose this model because it does not have noise cancellation which makes it easy to get someone's attention even when they are using the headphones.  They seem durable and comfortable with simple obvious controls.  We like that the headphones tell you the level of battery charge at startup. They turn themselves off when not in use.  Each of our three headphones connected without difficulty to two different devices (computer and phone) and they remember the connections when restarted.  We use them in the same room without any cross-talk or interference.  Although they fit our large heads, the over-ear cups are a bit smaller than most headphones and easily swivel to lay flat when not in use. Would buy again.","September 13, 2020",Verified Purchase,1

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Unexpectedly good,5.0,"I didn't know what to expect from a bluetooth headset in this low price range. My daily driver is a Sennheiser HD650.All I can say is wow, I was pleasantly surprised how good these sound. Tight bass, good mids, and treble that isn't too fatiguing. Battery life is great and the headset is comfortable with a very light weight and enough tension not to fall off easily. Bluetooth signal is solid and reliable on a variety of devices.Biggest convenience pros:  No touch controls - buttons are nice and clicky.  USB-C charging port - more and more devices are using this port format.Cons:  When moving from my PC to an Apple device, I need to first disconnect from my PC before it's able to connect property to my iPhone/iPad. Switching between Apple devices is seamless. This could just be down to a quirk in my PC's bluetooth vendor. Headset feels a little flimsy.Bottom line:  I'm using these as my daily driver now. Convenient, light, comfortable and great sounding headset for the money. Surpassed my expectations.","August 31, 2020",Verified Purchase,4

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",I paid $40 and I got a good pair for $40.,4.0,"First of all, I just want to note I paid $40 for these. I do not like earbuds at all so I needed a pair of on ear headphones for listening to audiobooks at night and talking on the phone at night because I have hearing issues and speaker doesn't cut it when I want to talk and game.Sound quality is ok. It's not particularly great but for voice it's fine. Music is ok but generally lacking bass, but I paid $40. The only time I will be listening to music on these are for yard work where I'm I'm fine with low quality. I have a $130 Audio Technica pair for really listening to music. The mic is fine for calling.The build quality on these are not for people who bang up their stuff. It's plastic and not a super strong one either. If you take care of it, you won't have issues though.Battery life however is excellent. I couldn't be happier in that regard.Overall giving these 4 stars. Are these worth $60, no.

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Excellent bang for the buck,5.0,"These headphones are perfect for me.  I use them mostly while working: listening to music and taking calls.They have a very balanced, neutral tone, so you can hear everything without the bottom or top end dominating.  They still have plenty of bass so that I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything.  If you're a, what the kids call, basshead, though, you will likely be disappointed.The best part about them is that they disappear on my head.  They're super light and fit my gigantic head very easily.  A lot of folks are concerned with how flimsy they feel, but I've got another set of wired Sony headphones with the same apparent build quality that have lasted me years.Battery life is as advertised, also.  They last easily through a work week without charging.The microphone does a good job in my quiet home office, but I don't think it would fare well in a busier environment like a coffee shop or airport.

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",these headphones are so insanely annoying that I am never buying another set of headphones from Sony,1.0,"So, before I start, I'm going to say that the headphones were fairly good, the sound quality was great, and straight outta the box they lasted a good few hours before i needed to recharge, so if you can stand the worst thing in the universe or don't mind removing the mic from the unit, go for it. That being said, the one thing that made me return these headphones (less than 12 hours after receiving the product) is a feature called ""sidetone"" and let me tell you I'd personally rather jump into the deepest pits of hell than have this feature. ""sidetone"" is a feature on these headphones that starts up the microphone, no matter if it should be being used or not, and collects all of the sound going on around you, multiplies the volume by 12, and then proceeds to play it back. Now that might not sound too bad, but believe me, this feature made me want to throw the headphones into a volcano and hope no one ever has to go through that experience ever again. I've gone threw every possible way to stop this from happening, and Sony's website said it's impossible to remove this feature","August 25, 2020",Verified Purchase,239

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Not what I expected from Sony,1.0,"I kept planning to return these as they are horrible to connect with my large screen LG TV.  It takes 3 to 5 minutes to get connected every time.  I kept thinking I was doing something wrong with them because it keeps saying connected, but it wasn't.  And then it was toggling back and forth, on and off to get it to connect properly.  Another issue with it is they are very flimsy and also the switches to turn up and down and on and off are all together, so you have to take them off to make adjustments while wearing them.  They did connect to my grandson's table easily, so now he owns them.  I will go back to the off-brand set and just buy a new pair.  I know they are not expensive but they are too much to just throw away because they don't work properly.  I've used Sony products since my first transister radio in 1968 in VietNam, but this was a total dissapointment to me.","July 2, 2020",Verified Purchase,9

The sound makes it hard to understand people or enjoy music.2) The echo every-time the mic is activated, have it be any sort of calls, you hear your own echo, along with every sound or noise around you amplified and heard back in a loop from your speaks along with the other person's noise in the call. This makes it hard to understand what people are saying and making things unclear.Overall I really like the idea and concept of this product, especially having the ability to move around freely without wires.

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Disappointing,1.0,"These headphones aren't noise cancelling. There's constant feedback of your surroundings you'll hear in headset. I guess because people mostly use this headset for phone calls they don't want to block out the surrounding noises because of liability issues? I don't know.They're not very comfortable. If you look down at all they will just slip off your head. Doesn't grip well to your head. They feel awkward because of the ear pieces can turn. Sound quality is lacking.I'm assuming these headphones are only good for maybe taking some calls, but aren't made well for long sessions of listening to podcasts or music.","April 16, 2020",Verified Purchase,19

My wife even uses them to watch her shows and loves them.  The batteries charge really quickly (30 minute quick charge) and will last for hours before needing a new charge.  If you do a full charge you can expect 7 to 10 hours of use.

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Great quality basic headphones,5.0,"I bought this at a big-box gadget store when I desperately needed one for a remote meeting while traveling. My previous set of bluetooth headphones had died.  When I purchase things in a rush I usually dont have great luck. I feel I got lucky here-- so far this is looking like a quality set of bluetooth headphones.I use these strictly for internet stuff-- remote meetings, training videos, some YouTube, or listening to the news on a podcast. I dont listen to dedicated music on these, nor am I an audiophile by any means.  So I cant speak to their quality there. I have been told that my Skype/Hangout meeting presence has much better sound clarity than I had before, and I can hear everyone on remote calls as if they are in the room with me. No muffling/dampening-- crystal clear voice.The battery life is unreal.  I charged it fully after my purchase and I have used it so far for about 8 hours of remote calls; each time I turn the headset on it still tells me ""Battery at 100%"". In other words, it doesnt seem to have drained a significant portion of battery energy yet! Other reviewers have claimed being able to use it for 3 weeks straight; I am starting to wonder if that may be true.Though these aren't advertised as noise-reducing, the earpieces are comfortably padded all the way around and block out a good portion of the room noise, making it easier to hear whats coming through the phones.  I'm partially deaf in one ear and this is a critical capability of any set of headphones I use.Bluetooth hookup was a snap, no hassling or fiddling.  (I am on a new MacBook Pro.). There are only 3 buttons on this-- power on/off, vol up, and vol down. Love the simplicity.Charge time is supposedly fast via usb-c-- claims of 10 minutes to fully charged-- but I havent had to charge them yet so I cannot say!Overall these seem like a great set of headphones.  If I didnt need them in a hurry I would have ordered them from Amazon; the price is about $20 cheaper here than what I paid in the store at BB.","February 24, 2020",Not Verified,0

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Very impressed by these,5.0,"I bought these for my 10 year old son for Christmas to replace a different pair of wired Sony headphones that he had. He loved his old pair, but the wire was getting obnoxious for him these past two years so we decided it was time to look at wireless options. He was so used to his other set, that I wanted something very similar but I also didn’t want to spend more than $40. He’s also very petite for his age (he fits a size 8 clothing) so finding something for him that’s comfortable is a challenge but I also didn’t want to pick out something babyish. I saw these for $34 and decided to take a chance and I’m extremely glad I did. I’m very impressed by these for a number of reasons. First- it’s wireless so that’s a huge upgrade for him. Second- it fits him very well but it also fits me, too. It’s comfortable. It’s almost noise canceling- you can still hear stuff but it sounds muffled. And the charge is amazing. He hasn’t charged it in the past 3 days and it’s still going strong. It was easy to connect to his iPhone. It feels more durable than a lot of the headphones out there. I feel like, if you’re on a budget or just not wanting to spend hundreds on a pair of headphones- if you’re a child, teen or adult- these work really well. I’m so glad we found these. I’m extremely happy. And our picky son is happy, too.","December 29, 2019",Verified Purchase,9

I cut my grass and later in the year blew snow, all on the same charge. Eventually I just plugged them in and charged em because I felt guilty.

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Solid set of headphones marred by less than optimal sound isolation,4.0,"I own several pairs of headphones and my dailies are the Sony WH-1000XM3 so I won't be comparing a $50 set of headphones to my $300 ones I use on a daily basis. That said, the WH-CH510's offer solid sound in a decent but not perfect form factor.SOUND: Per Sony's MO, the sound produced in these are exceptional. Right out of the box, with no burn-in, I felt the mids and highs were good and since I prefer less of a base, great overall sound balance. I wouldn't worry about not getting good sound out of these. That said, the ear pieces are a bit on the softer side and don't cover your ears completely so I can see them getting uncomfortable after several hours. Additionally I was told there was some sound leakage at higher volumes. On calls, I could hear my calls clearly and my voice was clear, though when on calls outdoors, there was some significant background noise. I won't comment on noise cancellation since it is clear it does not come with it and at $50, wouldn't expect it anyways.FUNCTION: The headphones come with 3 buttons, which I actually like better than touch controls (its very clear when you're pushing a button or wearing gloves) and worked well. Another plus is that it comes with usb-c charging and though it states is not fast-charging, I certainly felt I got plenty of charge on just 5-10 minutes. Finally, the battery life on this is fantastic. After using it for a few hours at home a week, I still haven't had to charge it once in almost a month.FORM: The form of the headphones leaves a bit to be desired. As mentioned previously, the cups on the ears are smaller than I would like and those the total headphone package feels small on the head and looks a bit funny vs larger headphones. It does have a tendency to look a bit plastic-y and I wasn't a huge fan of the patterned design on the side (prefer total matte black). It also doesn't come with a case, but even if it did, I would imagine the package would end up being bulkier than necessary as these only have hinges on the ear side and not mid-bridge.","November 17, 2019",Not Verified,0

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black","Good for podcasts, music, and audiobooks",4.0,"I have a weird mission to try headphones and look for that perfect for me set. These headphones are coming up close. So, while the plastic is not my favorite, it does make them light and they don’t seem really cheap, just regular plastic. But my head is average sized and my ears are tiny. My ears are 2 and 3/4 inches from top to bottom and an inch and 1/2 wide. So over the ear headphones are too large for my ears. The on the ear headphones are actually over the ear for my ears. So number one, I like the fit.Number two, I listen to podcasts, audiobooks, music and a lot of the music is orchestral. Most headphones give you bass so classical music is not that pure orchestral sound. And the additional bass distorts spoken words sometimes making the narrator difficult to understand. These headphones allow for different listening experiences and make those of us who listen to a lot of talking to still be able to enjoy listening with headphones.This stays put on my head. With most headphones, for me if I lean forward so does the headset and then they are on the floor. These, perhaps because they fit my tiny freak ears, do not slide off every time I lean over. I wore headphones for household work, walking the dogs (picking up poop) and yard work predominately.The battery is super long., I genuinely cannot remember the last time I charged them.  And the Bluetooth range is at least 100 feet, which I have not experienced before.There are only three buttons, so you need to read the manual to figure out how many times you depress a particular button to get it to do a specific task. I assume this is necessary, but it no less annoys me.The charging time was pretty fast.I waist that the ear pieces adjusted as well as the headpiece.I also wish that these had the option to be plugged in and listened to as well as wireless. It sounds silly, but if you travel a lot, you get why that is a nice option.So, too many button sequences to remember, can’t adjust the ear pieces, no wired option. Otherwise for the price the sound is the most versatile compared to other headphones I have owned. Nice fit for me. Holds a charge a long time. Charges quickly. Long Bluetooth range.","November 11, 2019",Not Verified,3

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Decent for the pricepoint,4.0,"They are no Beats, but on the whole these are decently comfortable headphones that seem to have a good range to the source device, are lightweight, and sound pretty good.  I wasn't blown away by noise cancellation, but I am not really a fan of blocking out all outside noise anyway.  My only real complaint is they didn't come in any type of bag or case, and don't really collapse for travel very well.  Several times I had to just chuck them in my purse or suitcase while traveling and was nervous they'd get broken but they managed to survive.If you are looking for decent wireless headphones at a lower price point these will work just fine.","October 28, 2019",Not Verified,1
"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Quality Headphones,5.0,"I was skeptical at first about using a pair of these big over the ear headphones because they always look so big and clunky but I am glad I gave them a try.  These are actually very light weight and comfortable to wear which surprised me.  They fit nicely on my head and are adjustable for a more snug fit if needed.  This helps because they actually stay on better when I'm exercising than my ear buds do.  The sound quality and battery life are great too.  The bluetooth range is also good, I can go into another room next door in my house and still have clear sound.  The ear portion can swivel so they are easier to store/carry.

We share them in the house and it's obvious that they fit well on smaller heads as well as larger ones. They are comfortable and easy to connect to your device, but the buttons are all close together and flush so it's very difficult to blindly push one while they're on, you almost have to take them off for that. The volume and clarity of sounds is great, but there isn't much bass, and I like bass with my music.

I personally am accustomed to the cheap ones, so I think these are pretty good! The ear cups are okay and offer minimal comfort. The sound quality is above average. The controls are functional.

You can hear everything. Now for sound quality, I'm no audiophile but these sound EXTREMELY good for a budget pair of headphones. They can almost compare to my XB900N's in terms of sound quality (besides good bass and customization options) but just for bare audio it's really good. The battery life on theses are INSANE at 35 hours and they came shipped at 100% out of the box which I love! They're basically plug and play headphones without an app to connect to like the more expensive pairs require.

Audio quality is good, but not as nice as a pair of “real” headphones. However, the wireless part of these headphones is fantastic.Battery life seems to be forever, and when turning it on, an electronic voice will inform you of the current battery level, no surprise of running out of power.Charging is through a USB-3 connector, which is mildly annoying at the moment, since nearly nothing else uses it and I don’t have a lot of cables lying around.

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Best Quality for Music Lovers,5.0,"My music has never sounded so good. I normally wouldn’t order headphones like this because I prefer ear pieces. I decided to give these a try, after all it is Sony. The sound on these headphones is amazing. It is without a doubt the best quality I have ever had. These give a clean, crisp, and smooth sound. They are actually really comfortable to wear. The controls are very easy to operate and pairing was a breeze. All I had to do is turn them on and they paired to my device immediately. The sound proofing and noise canceling is perfect. When these are on you will not hear any outside sounds at all. These are that good. Honesty I think these are under priced. The quality just can’t be measured. These came with a USB cord to charge but not the adapter. I have already recommended these to friends and family.

Except there’s a 55” TV in the room that I’d rather watch!Along comes this set of wireless headphones. Charged them per instructions. Easy setup for this tech novice, although I prefer words to pictures/graphics like these came with - why not both??Easily synced with my Roku tv & I was up and running.My biggest gripe is with the teeny buttons.I mean, really?? In Sony’s quest to be minimalist or whatever, you get black on black with barely a raised button to find with your fingers. For me, it means having to grab my readers every time I want to do anything. Not a huge thing since I’ll soon just feel my way, I guess, but just a little larger button or a little bit of bright color so you can see these in low lighting would be nice. Even the blue power indicator is microscopic.Biggest plus, of course, is the sound which is excellent. I don’t have any tech words for it, but the bass is booming & the treble is sharp & it’s always well-modulated so I’m not reaching for the up & down volume all the time.They also lay flat when not in use & adjust well for my (large) head!","October 13, 2019",Not Verified,2
"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Extremely Lightweight with Great Sound,5.0,"Three top reasons I give it five stars.1) Out of the box, I was suprised by how light and minimalist it is.  It almost looks like a plastic toy headphone.  It's lighter than all my other headphones in the same category.  I can wear it all day without feeling it on my ears.2) The sound is loud and clear.  Nothing is more important than a great sound.  The bass and treble are well blanced.  The microphone is clear too.  Phone calls are heard on the other end naturally without quality lost.  Voice commands work very well.3) It's USB-C charging.  Yes, it's time to join the 21st century.  I don't have to figure out which way to plug in, and it charges fast.  The battery lasts longer than i can enjoy, all day and more.For the price, you can't get better sound and comfort.I recommend it!","October 12, 2019",Not Verified,2

The headphones are lightweight and produce an amazing sound.  The y look good and feel even better.  The padding is very comfy and cushiony on my ears.  No slipping of my head, they have just the right amount of pressure to stay on my head without squeezing my ears.  They are also quite simple to pair and use.  My first impression right out the box was ""wow, what really cool looking headphones"".  The headphones charging last for  hours and hours which is a super plus for listening to music, playing games and my all time favorite, listening to audio books.  I can't and won't compare them to any other wireless headphones because these are my first pair ever and for me they are PERFECT.","October 11, 2019",Not Verified,2

She really likes that they are very lightweight, comfortable, have good sound and don't have a cord to catch on things.  These are her four criteria for what makes a really good set of headphones.

"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Great Sony Sound But At A Price,3.0,"If you’re reading this review, what you really want to know is, “Should I buy these”? The answer is Sort of...? Maybe...? Possibly...? with some MAJOR caveats.If you’re familiar with Sony headphones at all then you already know that the unboxing experience is underwhelming at best so I’ll just give you the 30sec run down. When you open the box, you get the headphones, a charging cable and the manual, that’s it. But like I said, unless you’re spending $200.-$350. You’re not going to get a case or even a bag for that matter. It’s just the Sony way. As for the build quality, well ummmmmm… Okay, there is a lot of plastic here and not quality plastic. Let’s just say it, these are 95% plastic. You know the plastic that feels like if you squeeze it just a little, something is going to snap? Yeah, they pretty much feel like that. And when I say they are 95% plastic, I mean, there’s not even any padding on the headband which makes them unbelievably uncomfortable especially if you’re bald like me. Even for short periods of time, these things just start to hurt the top of your head. Also, because of the cheapish plastic there is very little give (you definitely don't want to try to stretch them out unless you like snapping sounds). The only non plastic part on these is the ear pads (if you can call them that). Now I know these are “on-ear” headphones, but they are so small that they feel like they are on-ear for little kids, even my 8 year old, who uses a pair a wired Sony’s everyday for school, said they felt tight and small to him. I’m not sure what the material is that they used for the ear pads but someone really needs to make earmuffs out of this stuff. This things get hot FAST, even with a fan on, I could only wear them for very short periods of time. For something that gets so hot, they are also unbelievably thin. These is also no noise cancellation except for the passive noise canceling you get from having a vice on your head.Now, I see that confused look on your face because you probably remember earlier when I said that you might want to buy these even with all of those issues, why would I say that right? Because, again, in the Sony way, these things sound fantastic. Even straight out of the box with zero burn in time, they sound GREAT. The mids and highs have great presence and there is a surprising amount of thump in the low end. You also get 35 hours of playback. NOTE: there is a bit of confusion because the spec sheet on the description page says that these do NOT have quick charging, but I can confirm from the box and from actual use that these DO indeed offer quick charging via USB-C (yes, no padding but USB-C, go figure). Additionally, they do have NFC and the mics aren’t that bad when making phone calls (but seriously, how many people make phone calls from their headphones anyway). They support voice assist blah… blah… blah… but none of that really matters because I honestly can’t see you wearing them that long.Bottom line, this review came down to one thing for me. When I asked my kid who wants ANYTHING that’s new if he wanted these and he said “no thank you” and that pretty much told me everything I needed to know. But, I guess if you have a lot of hair for padding, don’t mind a vice on your head, are beyond careful (think Tiffany crystal in plastic form), and have to have a pair of brand name headphones then, yeah, these will work. HOWEVER, if it were my money (and for the same money or even less), there are significantly better offerings by Cowin, TaoTronics, Bluedio and others. Heck you can even find the Sony XB700’s for around the same price. But yeah, I still have to admit that these do sound great.This is usually where I put my signature ratings, but this time instead of saying “do I recommend these” I’m going to put it another way.Would I spend MY money on these? NoEmoji Rating: 😞Thanks for taking the time to read this review, I really hope that it helped. Cheers!","October 9, 2019",Not Verified,518
"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Great basic model headphones,4.0,"Like most people I love music and like most introverts I adore a good set of quality headphones and I've tried everything from beats by dre and jabra luxury headphone to generic walmart headphones to dollar store nonsense headphones. Pros and cons for easy readingPros- The sound quality is pretty great, it doesn't come with an app for base boosting or sharpening vocals but for a basic model they're enough to get you through a morning commute or a long plane ride- The start up is extremely user friendly; fresh out of the box hold the power button on the headphones to connect to bluetooth and you're ready to go-  Charging is fast, 10 minutes for 90 minutes of listening is more than acceptable compared to higher priced brands I've used in the past- They do get really really loud which is great if you're going to answer the phone with these and it still comes in crystal clear- Range is pretty great too, I turned them on and went from my upstairs bedroom to downstairs with no static or sound interference, to out of my house and down the driveway with no issues and great playbackCons- There's no case whatsoever, you get the cardboard box they come in and that's it so when you're not using them safe storage can be difficult- The design is what made me take a star off; they don't fit entirely around the ear so you can still hear what's going on around you and people can hear your music because they don't have that true over the ear fit, they're made of extremely lightweight flimsy plastic and there's no way to fold them, the ears swivel in and that's about it so the likelihood of these making it through a year for me personally is extremely slim.- They look and feel cheap; if the look matters to you I'd keep looking because there's nothing luxurious or fashionable about these headphonestldr - The sound quality is excellent and if you're willing to sacrifice the outward appearance of your headphones and the durability for a lower price these are your go to. If you want something that can travel well I'd keep looking.","October 6, 2019",Not Verified,6
"Sony Wireless Headphones WH-CH510: Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Mic for Phone-Call, Black",Budget look and feel but great sound quality,4.0,"This is a good sounding budget headset. It leans more toward the bright end but not excessively so.  The bass is more than adequate. Although it’s not quite as boomy as my Sony WH-XB700 headphones, it’s pretty close and enough to satisfy most listening needs.  The overall sound quality of these is actually pretty good given the $50 price.  The highs and mids are clear and well pronounced.  One area where these lag behind my XB700’s is build quality. The XB700’s are heavier, slightly larger and feel sturdier.  These are smaller, lighter and feel kind of frail by comparison.(UPDATE: a few weeks after writing this review, the headphones fell off a desk and into my path as I was taking a step. I ended up accidentally stepping on them with most of my body weight. Although I heard the cringe inducing sound of plastic flexing under too much weight, they did not get damaged at all.  Not even a scratch.  They also still sound great).I like that these at least have a USB-C charging port like the XB700 rather than the micro or mini USB charge ports typically found on less expensive headphones.  It allows me to charge both headphones with the same USB-C charger that I use for my Sony Xperia phone.  Operation is very simple.  There are only three buttons used for power, volume, music advance/repeat and Bluetooth pairing.I love the sound quality of these headphones but there are some pretty obvious signs that these are budget cans. The most obvious is the lack of any padding whatsoever on the head band.  The hard plastic head band is not the most comfy while in use and can become downright painful after an hour or so.  I keep the cans loose fitting on my head to avoid discomfort but that affects sound quality.  The on-ear cushions also aren’t the greatest quality.  The weight and appearance feel like budget cans.  Another downside is these don’t work with the Sony headphone app.Although some corners were obviously cut in the physical build and comfort areas, these CH510s do sound way better than they look and feel. They do stand out among lower priced headphones.  If looking for slightly better sound and head-vibrating bass, the XB700 is a better buy, especially if it can be found on sale.","October 4, 2019",Not Verified,6

This is also the cheapest way to get these that I have found rather than buying them individually in a store. Also who wants to go in a store right now? NOT ME!The scent we use are the crisp and clean ones. Basically I compare this to cotton or linen scents and it is just clean smelling. Fragrances mess with my allergies and this one doesn't.

"Pre-Moistened Lens Wipes ALIBEISS Screen Wipes for Glasses, Camera,Tablets, Smartphone, Screens and Other Delicate Surfaces,Pack of 100","These Are OK, But I am Still Searching...",3.0,"These Are OK. But I am still searching for some actual professional grade lens wipes All of the reviews I see are for phone's computer screens and glasses, etc. But high quality optical equipment like telescope lenses, and eyepieces and camera lenses are quite another matter. Because any residue left behind on those kinds of high powered optics, sticks out up like a sore thumb.And the main objection I have to these wipes is, they are just, ""too wet"". By this I mean they seem more like baby wipes than lens cleaners. The moisture in them seems very inert, almost like plain water, not like real lens cleaning fluid. So, they leave a lot of little droplets behind. And when the area you just cleaned dies out, there is a slight residue or a ""footprint"" that the cleaning pads leave behind them.This can be overcome after a fashion, by making light pass after pass over the area you are trying to clean. But that is a less than perfect way to go about cleaning your lenses. And also, it is still very difficult to get all of the slight hazy residue off of your lenses.The one bright spot is, they don't leave any lint behind at all. And in that regard they are far superior to the wet lens cleaning pads you normally get at your local Big Box retailer, or you average drugstore.I sure wish someone would come up with something especially for cleaning camera lenses, and telescope lenses, and microscopes.I wouldn't mind pay more for some good, higher quality, professional grade lens cleaning wipes.","September 30, 2020",Verified Purchase,0

I liked that a fairly large sized cloth was included in the package, as well.  The wipes didn't work well at all!  After just one week, some of the wipes are barely wet when opened.  They did not clean my prescription eye glasses well - the smudges/smears did not come off even after several attempts to gently wipe the lenses clean.  I did discover that when I used the wet wipes first then used the dry cloth included in the packaging, it worked good.  While this option works fine, I could have just brought a package of the dry cloths and avoided buying the wet wipes.  The cloth alone works fine, too.  This is the standard cloth that is often sold separately as a eyeglass and electronics screen cleaner.  I definitely didn't expect to have to use the wet wipes and the cloth as a two-step process to clean my glasses.  I wonder if this particular wet wipe doesn't work on my eye glasses possibly because of the material of my lenses.  Since some other reviews indicate that the wipes worked for them, maybe certain types of lenses material doesn't clean well with these wipes.  I have no other explanation for why these wipes didn't work well to clean my lenses.  I have to use several of them to clean my large monitor computer screen and they still didn't do a great job on the screen either.  I'm rather disappointed and would not buy these wipes again.  I have tried another brand before to clean my lenses and they worked just fine!

"Pre-Moistened Lens Wipes ALIBEISS Screen Wipes for Glasses, Camera,Tablets, Smartphone, Screens and Other Delicate Surfaces,Pack of 100",Only just usable. Not worth it.,2.0,"Cheap, but also bad value for money.1. Barely moistened, and totaly dries out in seconds. Tearing one sounds like tearing paper.2. Small. 6 x 4.5 inches and you cant lay them flat to use them, they dont ""slide"", so smaller surface area to use. Ok for glasses or a phone i guess, but not a laptop.3. I had to go over the same are multiple times to remove fingerprints and other smudges.4. Two stars because with enough effort and 3 or 4 wipes you can eventually clean a laptop. Also, as stated, they're individually wrapped.Conclusion: good for glasses and phones. Bad for laptops, especially for more than just a smear or print.","October 22, 2019",Verified Purchase,21
